      <description>How do we aggregate many individual preference orderings into a single group or social preference ordering; or, How can rational individuals make rational choices as a group  We can define a Social welfare function (SWF) combining individual preference orderings (over social states) into a social preference ordering (over those same states).</description>

      <description>Final paper for PHIL321
 The [[thoughts/Precautionary Principle|Precautionary Principle]] has had many different interpretations across [[thoughts/game theory]]; there is no single accepted formulation.</description>

      <description>If there is no profile where one player’s payoff is better but no player’s payoff is worse. Pareto optimality is a criterion of ‘group [[thoughts/rationality]]’, not a criterion for individual rationality (see: [[thoughts/Nash equilibrium]])</description>

      <description>Any interval scale can be linearly transformed (ordinal transformation) between each other and not be affected
Assign to each outcome $x$ a value $v(x)$ such that $v(x) \geq v(y) \iff x \geq y$ and $v(x) = v(y) \iff x \sim y$</description>

      <description>Decision rules when the probability of each outcome is known.
Requires an [[thoughts/interval scale|interval scale]]
When evaluating, we often need to quantify what outcomes are more [[thoughts/value|valuable]] than others</description>

      <description>Decision rules when the agent is ignorant of all probabilities
Rules Dominance  Weak Dominance: act $a$ is as good or better than $b$ for each possible state and there is at least one state where it is strictly better Strong Dominance: act $a$ is strictly better than $b$ for all possible states  Principle: 1.</description>

      <description>Modelling decisions where the outcome partially depends upon choices made by other rational agents. Assumes:
 Individual Rationality: each player maximizes their own utility and knows the full game tree/table Common Knowledge of Rationality: each player knows that all other players are rational  Two ways to look at game theory</description>
