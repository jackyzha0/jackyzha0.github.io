      <description>If no player can do better by unilaterally changing strategy, given the other players’ strategies. This is a criterion of individual rationality (see [[thoughts/Pareto optimality]] for group rationality)</description>

      <description>Any interval scale can be linearly transformed (ordinal transformation) between each other and not be affected
Assign to each outcome $x$ a value $v(x)$ such that $v(x) \geq v(y) \iff x \geq y$ and $v(x) = v(y) \iff x \sim y$</description>

      <description>Decision rules when the probability of each outcome is known.
Requires an [[thoughts/interval scale|interval scale]]
When evaluating, we often need to quantify what outcomes are more [[thoughts/value|valuable]] than others</description>

      <description>Decision rules when the agent is ignorant of all probabilities
Background Points  No information about probabilities A value function on outcomes a&amp;amp;s where a is an act and s is a state Most of the rules respect dominance  Rules  Dominance  Weak Dominance: act $a$ is as good or better than $b$ for each possible state and there is at least one state where it is strictly better Strong Dominance: act $a$ is strictly better than $b$ for all possible states Principle:  Avoid dominated acts and prefer dominant acts Can only use dominance principle if states are independent of acts Gold standard, use this whenever possible     Maximin/Leximin  Find the minimum value of each act Choose the act with the least bad worst-case outcome Note: can violate dominance if there are rows with the same minimum Leximin can help resolves ties by removing the minimum value in case of ties.</description>
