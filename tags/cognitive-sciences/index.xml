Extended view of the mind not an internal control system, enclosed in the human body, receiving data from human sensory system and directing human action instead, as systems that extend far beyond the body of the human organism, systems that include extra-somatic resources: environmental fuels for adaptive action suggest that human cognitive systems include those resources that are importantly, robustly, reliably, or persistently supportive of decisions making Theory of Niche Construction many animals intervene in their environment, shaping it in ways that improve the adaptive fit between the agent and its world such animals in part adapt to their niche, in part construct their own the niche construction perspective focuses our attention on the common features of this whole range of cases whereas the extended mind model does not human capacities, cognitive and non-cognitive alike, turn out to depend on the fact that humans engineer their environment to support their activities extended digestion example some animals do the hard digestion stuff on-board, powerful jaws, large mouths, lots of time chewing we cook lmao also, we selectively breed livestock which improves the food value of domestic stock Extended Phenotypes Concept things animals build are part of their phenotype (physical exhibited traits that are determined genetically) developmentally stable, as heritable and predictable in their ecological effects as other traits e.</description></item><item><title>Emergent Behaviour</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/emergent-behaviour/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 00:21:11 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/emergent-behaviour/</guid><description>How complex behaviour can arise out of seemingly simple rules
