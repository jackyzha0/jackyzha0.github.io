      <description>As it pertains to epistemic authority
Debates from Classical South Asia  Right and wrong aren’t directly perceptible to humans But some traditions in CSA say yes: revelation/sacred texts The source must be āpta with regard to what’s right and wrong; must have:  perfect knowledge of right and wrong the ability to communicate this knowledge at least lack the intention to lie, if not have the intention to communicate honestly   Vedas are author-less so can have no faults or biases &amp;ndash; uniquely trustworthy Dharmakīrti against authority of the Vedas  Even if there was a flawless revealed source, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t help as the the revealed source still has to be interpreted and this necessarily happens through human interactions mediated by language   Partiality makes communication possible, words are meaning-laden (see: terminology) because of conventions and usage  No one, then, can know the meaning of an &amp;lsquo;authorless&amp;rsquo; word: &amp;ldquo;it is not possible in the case of words that lack an [original] expounder&amp;rdquo; Common usage is partial and not an independent source of knowledge &amp;ldquo;Since the meaning of authorless words [can] be known neither from tradition, nor from reason, nor from the [ordinary] world, it is [only] proper [to say] that there is no cognition [of the meaning] in this case&amp;rdquo; See also: derived intentionality   Cannot trust other humans who are also flawed  &amp;ldquo;Indeed, a blind [person] does not find the way when led by [another] blind [person]!</description>

      <description>Nagel&amp;rsquo;s Bat Argument (against Physicalism)
 Physicalism (read: Materialism) is the thesis that everything that exists is physical. Physical facts then, are objective truth (&amp;ldquo;the kind that can be observed and understood from many points of view and by individuals with different perceptual systems&amp;rdquo;) Even if we knew everything about how the bat&amp;rsquo;s sonar system works, we would not know what is is like for the bat to perceive using this system.</description>

Types of epistemic injustice:
  Testimonial Injustice: giving a deflated level of credibility to a speaker&amp;rsquo;s word for no other reason other than identity prejudice in a way that harms the speaker  Hermeneutical Injustice: the injustice of having some significant area of one&amp;rsquo;s social experience obscured from collective understanding owing to hermeneutical marginalization  Learning new epistemic resources is difficult for multiple reasons</description>
