title: Setting up your GitHub repository
---

First, make sure you have Quartz [[index#ðŸª´ Get Started|cloned and setup locally]].

Then, create a new repository on GitHub.com. Do **not** initialize the new repository with `README`, license, or `gitignore` files.

At the top of your repository on GitHub.com's Quick Setup page, clickÂ the clipboard to copy the remote repository URL.

In your terminal of choice, navigate to the root of your Quartz folder. Then, run the following commands, replacing `REMOTE-URL` with the URL you just copied from the previous step.

```bash
# list all the repositories that are tracked
git remote -v

# if the origin doesn't match your own repository, set your repository as the origin
git remote set-url origin REMOTE-URL

# if you don't have upstream as a remote, add it so updates work
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
```

Then, you can sync the content to upload it to your repository. This is a helper command that will do the initial push of your content to your repository.

```bash
npx quartz sync --no-pull
```

> [!warning]- `fatal: --[no-]autostash option is only valid with --rebase`
> You may have an outdated version of `git`. Updating `git` should fix this issue.

In future updates, you can simply run `npx quartz sync` every time you want to push updates to your repository.

> [!hint] Flags and options
> For full help options, you can run `npx quartz sync --help`.
>
> Most of these have sensible defaults but you can override them if you have a custom setup:
>
> - `-d` or `--directory`: the content folder. This is normally just `content`
> - `-v` or `--verbose`: print out extra logging information
> - `--commit` or `--no-commit`: whether to make a `git` commit for your changes
> - `--push` or `--no-push`: whether to push updates to your GitHub fork of Quartz
> - `--pull` or `--no-pull`: whether to try and pull in any updates from your GitHub fork (i.e. from other devices) before pushing
