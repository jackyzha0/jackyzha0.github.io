title: "Fruit"
description: "Of course, a knowledge index isn’t much use if it doesn’t inform future thinking and output. Fruits are what I like to call derivative or ’new’ pieces of content. This is new work created from saplings, mostly longer form essays, projects, etc. At this stage, thoughts and ideas have matured enough to be able to share and collaborate."
