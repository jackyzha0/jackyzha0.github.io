## Not work

Contrary to popular belief, I actually have other things I do outside of writing questionable code and school! Here are some things that I'm up to nowadays:
### Reading
There's nothing like cozying up with a cup of hot barley tea on a rainy day with a great book. I've recently rediscovered the joy of reading thanks to someone very close to me.

Currently Reading
* **The Art of Thinking Clearly** by Rolf Dobelli

Some of my past favourites
* **21 Lessons for the 21st Century** by Yuval Noah Harari
* **A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor** by Hank Green
* **The Uninhabitable Earth** by David Wallace-Wells

[Full Booklist](/books). I'm always happy to add to my ever-growing list of books to read or to chat about any cool reads you've come across!

### Writing
Recently, I've made a conscious effort to start writing more in order to help myself organize my thoughts. You can find a collection of my half-baked thoughts over on [my blog](https://blog.jzhao.xyz/) where I plan to write more about some of my thoughts on tech, personal projects, and general musings about the world.

### Music + Podcasts
According to my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/notecho?si=9bKqHkhLQFenGqlXza2F2Q) wrapped, I spent 109,535 minutes listening to music and podcasts in the past year. Some of my favourite artists include Jeremy Zucker, Rex Orange County, HONNE, Daniel Caesar just to name a few. Ocassionaly, I'll bust out a musical or a movie soundtrack from the likes of Dear Evan Hansen or La La Land. During long transits I can always count on [The Radical AI Podcast](https://www.radicalai.org/), [Philosiphize This!](https://www.philosophizethis.org/), and the [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/) to open the door to something new to learn about.

### Arts 'n crafts
When I'm feeling *really* adventerous, I'll try my hand at some watercolour or maybe a crochet project or two. Plus, they make nice presents :) I don't have any nice pictures to show you but you'll just have to trust me that they're at least half-presentable.
