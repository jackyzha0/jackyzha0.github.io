An end that cannot be achieved through direct pursuit, but only through pursuit of some other end. For example, meditation and achieving an empty mind, loving another, etc.

Paradox of hedonism: one cannot achieve pleasure by pursuing it directly, but only by devoting oneself to some other end (Sidgwick, 1907)
