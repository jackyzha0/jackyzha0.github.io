## Does language dictate how we think about the world?
- importance of vocabulary
- do we need labels and [terminology](thoughts/terminology.md) to discuss things
- false dichotomies
- Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is true -- but the effects are far more pronounced for programming languages than for spoken languages.

The [[thoughts/language|language]] you write code in ends up shaping huge parts of you worldview even when you're not programming (sapir-whorf, [language of thought](thoughts/language%20of%20thought.md)). The best purpose of language in general, and programming languages in particular is to expand the domain of thinkable thoughts

The power of programming languages (and why you may want to learn them, even if not intent on building software) is that they let you get you hands dirty with building and using ur own abstractions.
