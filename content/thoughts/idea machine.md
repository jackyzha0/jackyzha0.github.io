> Idea Machine: a network of operators, thinkers, and funders, centered around an ideology, that’s designed to turn ideas into outcomes.

**An Idea Machine is a self-sustaining organism that contains all the parts needed to turn ideas into outcomes:**
- It starts with a distinct _ideology,_ which becomes a memetic engine that drives the formation of a _community_
- The community’s members start generating ideas amongst themselves
- Eventually, they form an _agenda_, which articulates how the ideology will be brought into the world. ([Communities need agendas](https://nayafia.substack.com/p/27-friend-groups) to become idea machines; otherwise, they’re just a group of likeminded people, without a directed purpose.)
	- Does agenda come first or ideas? I would think agenda first for more autocratic orgs and ideas for more [[thoughts/autopoiesis|autopoietic]] orgs
- The agenda is capitalized by one or several major _funders_, whose presence ensures that the community’s ideas can move from theory to practice – both in terms of financing, as well as lending operational skills to the effort. (Without funding, an idea machine is just that: an inert system that needs fuel to turn the crank and get it moving.)

Idea machines are different from _movements,_ which are focused on achieving a specific outcome and are therefore self-limiting (if they succeed, the movement winds down). On the other end of specificity, idea machines are less broad than _paradigm shifts,_ which are widespread, headless, decentralized shifts in cultural norms and attitudes due to changes in systemic conditions.
