> Freedom is the simple combination of awareness and acceptance. It is the ability to be conscious of the constraints within you live

Our *default* definition of freedom, to just be able to do whatever, falls apart when we consider that we are limited beings (something something freewill). We will never be able to achieve unlimited human capacity and ability, and as such, no matter how comfortable our lives get, we will always feel slightly trapped. Thus, this is a non-functional definition of freedom.

A utopia is not truly a utopia unless we accept our boundaries. In a world of unlimited need, the only way to be 'free' is to accept the finiteness of the world.

## Web3
[web3](thoughts/web3.md) allows us to codify and define these boundaries for ourselves. By itself, it is not a technology that makes us 'more free,' but by explicitly stating the boundaries we create, we can create the freedom.

"This is a critical point: the products we create should not aim to make people 'more free' - that way lies false marketing campaigns and disappointment. Our products should be conscious of, and communicate clearly, how they constrain the people who use them."
