> The future is manifested

Shared fiction as a statement about the future instead of a statement of today. They're both fictions in that they can't be (dis)proved and thus can have the same functions in a group of people (bring together, motivate to action, share values/language, etc.)

Build as if your creations had [skyhooks](thoughts/skyhooks.md) you could hang them off of.

> To see things as they really are, you must imagine them for what they might be. -- Ruha Benjamin

In part why I really like reading things like The Book of Predictions where people from the 1970s just make predictions about the far future and see how correct they were. A lot of completely wrong predictions but some are eerily accurate (e.g. distributed and accessible compute). Now, you look at todays predictions of the future and it looks the same as the dreams we had 50 years ago about flying cars and space-faring societies. 

Where are our futures with no famine and disease? With a clean and healthy planet? Of universal free access to information? Where did the ambition go?

## Social Theory as Science

"Where, in earlier generations, science fiction projections seemed to regularly become reality a generation later, now they remain trapped on the screen--even if the screen images look increasingly realistic." (321)

## The Big Here and Long Now
> "Humans are capable of a unique trick: creating realities by first imagining them, by experiencing them in their minds. When Martin Luther King said "I have a dream", he was inviting others to dream it with him. Once a dream becomes shared in that way, current reality gets measured against it and then modified towards it."

The act of imagining something makes it real. Art as processes or the seeds for processes - things that exist and change in time, things that are never finished.

## Fiction as shared visions
 _Visions matter_. Visions give people a direction and inspire people to act, and _a group of inspired people is the most powerful force in the world_. If you're a young person setting off to realize a vision, or an old person setting off to fund one, I really want it to be something worthwhile.
