> Learning as an act of becoming really good at exploring terrain -- Shaun Martin

Framework for knowledge
1.  Sensing → info intake, active reading
2.  Reasoning → asking questions, applying knowledge, critical thinking
3.  Acting → learning by doing

How does this tie with [academia](thoughts/academia.md) and whether individuals are scared to try new things or now?

As historically human creatures, learning and obeying [social contracts](thoughts/social-contracts.md) is how we've survived. As a result, we can distinguish actions as either discovery (child-like curiosity, discovering the world and its causal relations) or ritual (following exact actions because you were taught to fit in).

There was an experiment of subjecting young children (~5-6yrs) to a game of Powerball where a ball could be passed back and forth between 3 people. Later in the game, the ball wasn't passed to one of the children, leading to feelings of social exclusion. This then led the young children to adopt more ritualistic approaches to learning rather than discovery-based.
