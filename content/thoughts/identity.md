## On Website Redesigns
> There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle?
> 
> Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity." --[Laurel Schwulst](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/)

About every half a year, I get an intense urge to redesign my website. Some years I overhaul everything, ripping out the content and gutting the divs and p tags. Other years, I make only minor changes, giving it a fresh coat of paint and changing out old typography for new ones.

I find it hard to place a finger on exactly why I feel this way. The colours, font spacing, and content -- they don't feel 'me'. How did something that used to feel so perfect and intimate feel so alien and off-kilter?

Our digital artifacts and spaces are reflections of our real selves. We feel like we outgrow digital spaces just as we change, learn, and grow in real life.

In part, this is why I think having your own little plot on the internet to change and modify at your own whim is worth protecting. This is our last little bit of land in an era where we leave our wizardly powers to build worlds of our choosing at the door of digital giants.

> Think about it: there’s no way to make a web page or a blog that is not an act of playing with its form at the same time as you're creating its content. So it just seemed natural: the world was always telling me that you worked on those two things – the container and its contents – together.

## Digital Legibility
Extensions on [[posts/digital-identity|relational identity]]

- identity constantly shifts in real life depending on who you are around
- we try to approximate this using multiple accounts -> prevent [[posts/context-collapse|context collapse]]
- but identity shouldnt feel like different accounts you hop between different digital platforms
- identity should be the principles of your experience -> applicable across contexts
- digital identity should enable novel interactions, not try to simplify existing ones
- identity systems rely on the concentration of power in the hands of operators who cannot possibly be fully aligned (financially, socially, or morally) with all of their users—for example, private social media companies with diverse global audiences must often [make decisions](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension) about what constitutes an act of unjustified censorship versus an act in the interest of public safety, though they are often ill-equipped to do so
