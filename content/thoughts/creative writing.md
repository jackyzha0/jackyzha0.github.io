We have a name for the tendency to go on a reasonable number of random walks: we call it "creativity."
### Common misconceptions

- Creative [[thoughts/writing|writing]] is about creating 'literature' and not genre stories: it is more so a question of quality than content
- Writing is an innate talent: writing is a tool that can be honed and practiced
- No real world application for creative writing: almost all conversations, media, arguments, involve some form of convincing the other side! what better way to do that than through story telling
- The riddle of storytelling
  - Imagine two groups of early humans competing for the same resources who lived pretty much the same
  - The first group gossiped and told stories during their leisure time while the second group continued working
  - We know the first group survived because that's us! So why is story telling so evolutionarily beneficial? It's a form of simulation (see also: [[thoughts/consciousness#Behaviourist approaches|behaviourist approaches to consciousness]])

### Classic Story Structures

- Freytag's Pyramid
  - Exposition
  - Rising Action
  - Climax
  - Falling Action
  - Denouement
- Kurt Vonnegut's Shape of Stories
- Joseph Campbell's "Hero's Journey" (story wheel)
  - Character is in a zone of comfort
  - But they want something
  - They enter an unfamiliar situation
  - Adapt to it
  - Get what they wanted
  - Pay a heavy price for it
  - Then return to their familiar situation
  - Having changed
- Three Act Structure
  - Act I: Get your guy up a tree
  - Act II: Throw rocks at him
  - Act III: Get him outta the tree

### Aspects of Stories

- McGuffin: an object, device, or event that is necessary to the plot and the motivation of the characters, but insignificant, unimportant, or irrelevant in itself.
- The universal grammar for stories: character + conflict = change
- Plot: the how of the story. Explicit. A series of actions, taken by characters, towards their wants, needs or desires
- Theme: the why of the story, the "so what". Should be
  - Universal
  - Specific
  - Implied
- Summary (general information, tell) vs Scene (specific descriptions, show)

### Writing Pitfalls

- Structural ambiguity: missing important story beats (e.g. Four undramatic plot structures) -- you need character, conflict, and change

* Clich√©/Familiar phrasing: don't do things that are incredibly overdone
* Awkward exposition: having conversations that characters would never actually have for the sake of reader understanding
* Abstractions: don't invoke abstractions, make it concrete, reify it

- Vagueness (unclear) vs Ambiguity (up to interpretation)
- Deus Ex Machina: god from the machine, heavy handed use of magic or coincidence to solve a conflict
- Characters: be aware of your defaults
  - There not always a person but instead an element of storytelling -- a vehicle on which the action of the story plays out

### Storytelling techniques

- Voice
  - How your characters speak, their voice and diction
  - The language you use as the author
- Irony
  - Verbal irony: the device by which we say one thing and mean another
  - Dramatic irony: the device by which the audience has crucial information that the characters do not
  - Cosmic irony: our understanding of the human condition, in which efforts are thwarted despite our best intentions

### Poetry

- Assonance: repetition of a vowel sound between consonants that may or may not match
- Consonance: repetition of the consonant that concludes a word or syllable
- Alliteration: repetition of an initial consonant sound
- Rhyme
  - True rhyme: both the vowel and consonant of the last accented syllable correspond
  - Internal rhyme: the end of one line rhymes into the beginning or middle of noather
  - Off-rhyme: near-rhyme, slightly discordant or 'not quire there' rhymes (four-inch, door hinge)
- Line: a typographical break representing a slight oral pause or hesitation
  - It adds a kind of emphasis both to the last word of the line and the first of the next line
