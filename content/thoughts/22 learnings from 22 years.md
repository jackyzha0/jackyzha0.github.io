1. let yourself be enchanted by the light
	1. sunset is beautiful
	2. let yourself be enthralled by the way the rays filter through the trees and bounce off of the waves
2. choosing it makes all the difference
	1. you can choose joy
		1. my phone lockscreen has been this
		2. nothing stops! the nihilist probably doesn't build any sandcastles. They leave the beach and drown themselves, or sit grumpily in the car. But I want to have fun _now_ and _play_.
	2. you can choose how you spend you hours because how you spend your hours is how you spend your life
3. a yes means nothing if you never say no
4. unabashed excitement is Good (tm)
5. learning is learning
	1. If you spend five hours on a problem and can't figure out the answer, it doesn't mean you haven't learned, it means _you spent five hours learning_. Your brain has rewired and formed new attractor states, you've done necessary work, the activity you've done is called learning. (https://io0.github.io/)
6. you can change your mind
7. external advice as a silly dog
8. Don’t surround yourself with people ‘smarter’ than you. **Surround yourself with people who are free in ways you are not**
9. What I’ve come to learn over the past year is that there are two types of people: people who make the right decision and people who make the decision right.
10. Take compliments in stride: “aw, thank you that means a lot” instead of “nahhh”
11. “Genius is no more than childhood recaptured at will.” *(Charles Baudelaire)*
12. There is a very fine line between doing something too easy, too difficult, just right (see: [[thoughts/game design]])
13. software abstractions that are difficult to learn are transformative because they make you think about it in an entirely new mental model
	1. e.g. rust or vim
14.
