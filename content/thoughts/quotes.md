Some quotes to live by.

1. "**Choose joy.** Choose it like a child chooses the shoe to put on the right foot, the crayon to paint a sky. Choose it at first consciously, effortfully, pressing against the weight of a world heavy with reasons for sorrow, restless with need for action."

3. "Who are the people, ideas, and books that magnify your spirit? Find them, hold on to them, and visit them often." (re: [friendship](thoughts/friendship.md))
4. "Forgiveness is the alchemy by which the shame transforms into the honor and privilege of being invited into another’s darkness and having them witness your own with the undimmed light of love, of sympathy, of nonjudgmental understanding.

(Source: Steve Grand, Creation: Life and How to Make It) (re: [skyhooks](thoughts/skyhooks.md))
6. "People need to be able to shape, extend, reconfigure, and repair their environment to feel truly at home within it...
