A activity -> core business activity
B activity -> reduce product-cycle time, make faster, smarter, higher-quality A activities (increase velocity)
C activity -> reduce improvement-cycle time, make faster, smarter, higher-quality B activities (increase acceleration)

The DKR is a wonderful example of the kind of investment that you can start making at the C level, with modest means, that will pay dividends back as it moves up the line to the B and the A levels. This is exactly what I mean when I talk about "bootstrapping." It is a very American term – the image is of someone able to perform the wonderful, impossible trick of pulling himself up by pulling up on his own bootstraps – but the idea is one that we put into practice every time that we "boot up" a computer. A small bit of code in a permanent read only memory knows how to go out to the disk to get more instructions, that in turn know how do to even more things, such as getting even more instructions. Eventually, this process of using successive steps to lead to ever bigger steps, building on each other, get the whole machine up and running. You start small, and keep leveraging what you know at each stage to solve a bigger and bigger problem.

“The problem is that software engineers don’t understand the problem they’re trying to solve, and don’t care to,” says Leveson, the MIT software-safety expert. -> [software-and-politics](/thoughts/software-and-politics)
