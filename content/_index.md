Welcome to my little [garden](posts/networked-thought.md) on the [internet](thoughts/Internet.md) -- I'm Jacky! I spend a lot of time here [playing](posts/play.md), [[thoughts/writing|writing]], and [building out in the open](thoughts/building%20in%20public.md). It's a little unkempt in places, but I think it gives it a little charm.

Currently, I do [[thoughts/Rhizome Research Log|independent research]] focused on how we can enable [[posts/towards-data-neutrality|data neutrality]] on a web dominated by data moats. In my spare time, I create and [[thoughts/maintenance|maintain]] a number of widely used open-source [projects](thoughts/Projects.md).

I'm curious about how we can better [incentivize](thoughts/incentives.md) [public goods](thoughts/public%20goods.md) [funding](thoughts/funding.md), support better [interactions](thoughts/interaction%20design.md) with computers and [[thoughts/Rhizome Proposal|data]], and be more responsible stewards of technology.

In this era of my life, I’m working towards being someone who is [unabashedly excited and curious about the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khfe3jBuq8c&list=PLMs_JcuNozJbxC91R5skgPpL7cnJuICun).

Though I can't quite yet provide you a guided tour of this digital garden, I can leave you a handful of links to places as suggestions.

- [The fruit garden out back](/posts): a collection of my favourite writing;
- [The hand-crafted oak workbench](thoughts/Projects.md): a collection of projects I've hacked on;
- [The crumpled pages in the recycling bin](posts/a-failure-resume.md): my failure resume;
- [The bookshelf on the far wall](/books): books that are in some state of read, reading, or want to read.
