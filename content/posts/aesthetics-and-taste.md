*John Reeve (1958-61, 1966)*

Taste goes by many names: intuition, conviction, self-trust, aesthetics. Roughly, it is the ability to make judgements about aesthetic value; to instinctively tell the difference between what is beautiful or not.

It turns out that beyond the usually positive connotations of having 'good taste' when it comes to food, art, or media, it is also instrumentally useful in finding what is meaningful and worthwhile to spend our lives on.

In research, brilliance often isn't only about the ability to execute and solve problems (though that's important too). The best researchers are the best at *knowing what types of questions to ask and answer* -- they have good research taste.

>  "It is not so much, it seems to me, a so-called “brain power” that makes the difference between this mathematician and another, or between one piece of work and another of a same mathematician; but rather the quality of finesse, of the greater or lesser delicacy of this openness or sensitivity, from one researcher to another or from one moment to another in the same researcher. The most profound and fruitful work is also that which attests to the most delicate sensitivity in apprehending the hidden beauty of things."

Though Grothendieck refers to math here, I think the observation generalizes. There is this thread through many different disciplines where a pursuit of the craft because you find it inherently _beautiful_ -- to like it in and of itself -- reveals a deeper, more fundamental understanding.

For any creative pursuit, this ability to notice more deeply is what distinguishes good from great. It is a form of attention that starts to reveal the infinite depth of the world. This is how you will begin to notice nuances you hadn’t seen before. You begin to see wider and deeper.

Annie Dillard relates a tale from a fellow writer who was asked a question by a student:

> "Do you think I could be a writer?"
>
> "Well," the writer said, "I don't know... Do you like sentences?"
>
> The writer could see the student's amazement. Sentences? Do I liked sentences? I am twenty years old and do I like sentences? If he had liked sentences, of course, he could begin, like a joyful painter I knew. I asked him how he came to be a painter. He said, "I liked the smell of paint"
> 
> If you’re going to be a gardener, it helps to like the smell of roses. If you’re going to be a writer, it helps to appreciate sentences. That, however, only happens once you’ve spent many afternoons reading.

If taste is knowing what is beautiful, then taste serves as a guide that gives us hints as to what is worthwhile; what to keep and what to toss.

Taste is a particularly _good_ guide for answering the question of "what is worthwhile" because we've normalized taste as a sort of ineffable, subjective thing.

When I find the craftsman ship of one mug I make more aesthetic than another, I'm not expected to justify it to myself that the walls are slightly more even or that the glaze fired slightly more blue on the other. I'd like to think that I've started to develop a palette for what personally feels and looks good in pottery. I really like sharp walls that are slightly tapered outwards. They shouldn't be too thin or the piece will feel flimsy and fragile but it also shouldn't be too heavy enough or it will feel like a heavy rock in your hand. I particularly like more speckled clay bodies that are more earthy and warm in tone paired with slightly cooler glazes. The ones I've been really enjoying as of late are double layered ones with a creamy white base layer and a beautiful layer of celadon overtop. Sometimes, you can hear a faint tinkling when they are fresh out of the furnace as the glaze contracts and forms beautiful internal cracking patterns.

I have very explicitly avoided trying to define my taste of pottery in terms of specific styles or potters. I know that if I did feel that pressure, I would have spent a lot more time learning and reading about various pottery techniques, the names of different forms, and what glazes have been popular on social media.

How I focus on pottery would purely be in terms of what has historically been done. I would think about the shape of the walls insofar as it produces the right shape that I see other people make.

- you will only do what has come before and has been repeated
	- but nothing new and nothing lively
- kills out of deviation thinking
- for most things, emulating the best of what has already been done before is probably 'good enough' for most things
- not to say "don't ever look outside"
	- but rather, look to others for inspiration to helps you attend to things you otherwise would not have noticed
	- we shouldn't ever use the taste of others to replace our own because this is where originality emerges
	- even when we do develop the language and or learn the history, it's after we've spent enough time sitting with it to know _what it is and might be_ and are ready to share it with the world

- tk transition ???

- an interest to get it right or to 'do it like they do' constrains us
	- [[thoughts/Simone Weil|Simone Weil]] believed that the way which you direct your [[thoughts/attention|attention]] drastically influences _how_ you experience the world. To attend means not to seek, but to wait; not to concentrate, but instead to dilate our minds. We do not gain insights, Weil claims, by going in search of them, but instead by waiting for them.
	- not waiting in the literal do nothing sense
	- but rather let the actual nature of doing the thing reveal itself through our preferences
	- it is a [[thoughts/self-effacing ends|self-effacing end]] that cannot be pursued directly
- intellectual playfulness
- what is worthwhile isn't always immediately legible
	- kuhn paradigm shifts
- and so ineffability via play (i.e. non-goal oriented play) helps us avoid these traps
	- This ineffability affords a certain lightness to how one might hold ideas and knowledge. It lets us try ideas on for size without needing to immediately jump to explain it to others.
	- These nascent moments when you are exploring something that is new, trying to coerce it in terms of what we already know or what is palatable to others is actively harmful to developing your own taste.
- truly groundbreaking work requires the capacity to go beyond what they were taught
- relying on managed creativity bad
- hard because we grow up learning frameworks for what is value
	- that is, we have outsourced our value systems for what is good/bad (how we may judge aesthetic value) to other people

Taste is a particularly _good_ guide for answering the question of "what is worthwhile" because we've normalized taste as this ineffable, subjective thing.

We, as a society, have collectively decided that the thoughts, decisions, and ideas we attribute to taste are waived of the typical responsibility of having to be made immediately legible and understandable.

When I find the form of one mug I make more aesthetic than another, I'm not expected to justify it to myself that the walls are slightly more even or that the glaze fired slightly more blue on the other. Because aesthetics are subjective, there is no expectation that you need to agree with my aesthetic judgement of the mug.

This ineffability affords a certain lightness to how one might hold ideas and knowledge. It lets us try ideas on for size without needing to immediately jump to explain it to others.

Thomas Kuhn pointed out that the biggest ideas [transcend the existing paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift) and create their own lane.

If we look to history of [[thoughts/Scientific Freedom|scientific progress]], we see plenty of evidence that relying exclusively on the opinions of others for what is worthwhile to pursue only inhibits progress. Managed creativity can, at best, produce only what its managers specify.

Vannevar Bush: "scientific progress on a broad front results from the free play of free intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown." 

Creativity is the essence of the human spirit, and flowers best when it's unconstrained. If you try to control it for your own ends you must learn that you can get only what you ask for and nothing more.

In this vein, we've seen many aphorisms in the realm of Pablo Picasso's "Without great solitude, no serious work is possible" and James Baldwin's "Perhaps the primary distinction of the artist is that he must actively cultivate that state which most men, necessarily, must avoid: the state of being alone."

In practice, however, what they are referring to as solitude is not being physically isolated but rather more of a state of mind. They are putting themselves in a state where the opinions of others do not bother them and where they reach a heightened sensitivity for the types of questions worth asking -- they've developed their taste[^2].

[^2]: Though this *has* some historical precedence for happening through physical isolation (e.g. Newton, Grothendieck, Pascal, Baldwin), I largely believe the lone genius myth is false. The lone genius is a proxy for being a hard worker but it isn't the only way of doing [[posts/pain-and-great-work|great work]].

This critical developmental period is almost always in environments where there is little to no pressure to conform to existing frameworks of thinking. They didn't worry themselves with what was novel or unexplored, but rather what was beautiful and interesting. Often, this leads to repeating work that may already have been done (like Einstein reinventing parts of statistical physics or Grothendieck working out his own formal definitions for length). But by the time they *did* hit novel territory or the bounds of human knowledge, it no longer mattered to them because they just kept doing what they were already doing. They did not seek the safety of knowing or the safety of a legible question, but were okay with lingering in the depths of illegibility until something deeper, more unifying, arose.

We grow up going to school which teaches us a framework for what is valuable: being excellent at following rubrics, saying what others want to hear, and rote memorization without inquiry. Academic teaches us another framework: citations are indicative of how novel or impactful your work is, results matter more than the process. Work teaches us yet another framework: what makes us money is what is worth your time, your value as a person is tied to the work you output and the money you make.

These aren't inherently bad frameworks to live by. In fact, some might argue that these are good value systems to live by because they are decent approximations of what fulfilling and meaningful work might look like for people who haven't chosen to ask that question of themselves. However, like with anything mediating, they serve as band-pass filters -- killing off the worst ideas but also the best ones (because they too are outside of the [[thoughts/Overton Window|Overton Window]]).

The crux is that as we grow through these various stages of life, we jerk and mold ourselves into the various value systems, contorting the narratives we tell ourselves to fit what others tell us we should value. Our self-worth is dictated by how much you can justify your work and values within the context of the taste of others and we end up in situations where one is always 'behind' and 'catching up.' In what world is a game of constant catch-up fulfilling?

As we outsource our opinions all the time, we no longer exercise our own taste and lose the capacity to derive our own value systems. Like a muscle, it decays without frequent use and we default to liking and valuing what everyone around us already likes or does.

Having strong taste -- a deep seated conviction -- helps to create their own possibilities for what is possible, outside what other people believe, relying on their intrinsic, subjective judgement of what feels correct. Truly groundbreaking work requires the capacity to *go beyond the context they were raised in.*






C Thi. Nguyen calls this lightness of ideas *[[thoughts/Jestermaxxing|intellectual playfulness]]*. When an intellectually playful person evaluates new ideas, they don't care about plausibility or legibility. They care about cool ideas, or elegant ones, or thrilling joy-rides of discovery. They care about exploring where exploration is joyful.

Nguyen argues that this intellectual playfulness or *lightness of ideas* actually has some clear [[thoughts/epistemology|epistemic]] functionality for us. A pure 'truth-seeker' has an interest in always getting it right. This attitude constrains the search space, focusing searches on plausible paths to explore and discarding what is implausible or beyond the pale. However, because their assessment of plausibility will always proceed from their standing system of beliefs, even their most rational epistemic attempts can be caught in what Nguyen calls an epistemic trap: belief systems that make us shut down a line of questioning before exploring its validity.

These traps manipulate background beliefs to fend off contrary evidence. Echo chambers, for example, creates a significant [[thoughts/trust|trust]] disparity between members and non-members, leading members to dismiss any and all contrary evidence coming in from the outside. 

Similarly, Alexandre Grothendieck thought that a fear of being wrong functioned as an epistemic trap, causing our thoughts and ideas to calcify, refusing to .

> "One who fears to be wrong is powerless to discover. It is when we are afraid of making mistakes that the mistake inside us becomes immovable like a rock. Because in our fear, we cling to what we have decreed to be “true”, or what has always been presented to us as “true”. If we are moved, not by the fear of seeing an illusory security vanish, but by a thirst for knowing, then error, like suffering or sorrow, will cross us without ever becoming frozen, and the trace of its passage will be a renewed understanding."

The 'right' thing to do is to sometimes go on random walks in idea space -- to explore idea unconstrained by the need to optimize for truth every step along the way. And, he says, we have a name for the tendency to go on a reasonable number of random walks: we call it "creativity" or "taste.

> "Creation is the act of bringing something nonexistent into reality. You have to have strong opinions about how the world should work. You have to think that things should be a certain way, that you prefer this color over that, this form of walking over another, this sense of beauty over theirs, this way of approaching the world over some other. Taste gives you the capability and the urgency to imagine."
> 
> -- Spencer Chang, *[creative seeing](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/creative-seeing)*

Well-developed taste is conviction. Great ideas are easy to kill. An idea in its infancy is easy to prod, poke, and find holes in. Of course they are; we generally evaluate ideas relative to the existing paradigm or ways of thinking. 

Any act of creation necessarily involves strong opinions about how the world should work -- strong enough to survive the sharp edges of doubt and the false allure of safety in what is known and what has been done.

Sufficiently developed taste gives us the conviction that lets us interface with others as potential sparks of inspiration rather than the prime directive for what to believe in.

How might we cultivate our taste?

Quoting Voltaire: "In order to have taste, it is not enough to see and to know what is beautiful in a given work. One must feel beauty and be moved by it." The world reveals itself to those who attend to it.

Each day is an exercise in developing taste. That’s all life is really -- a giant sequence of decisions. Taste is built over time through repeated applications. It requires intention, focus, and care. It’s a process of peeling back layer after layer, turning over rock after rock. It is the manifestation of [[thoughts/self-confidence]] in what we find beautiful and aesthetic. 

Do things without recipes more often. Trod the unbeaten path more often and take note of how things feel.

In making these decisions, you choose to pay attention to different aspects of your lived experience. With time,

Curiosity and an inherent observatory nature toward the world serve as constant opportunities to test your taste. The process of cultivating taste is a lot like the writing and editing process.

- use opinions of others to bring more things into your periphery but never evaluate the merit of a thing solely based on the opinions of others
- attend to things more carefully, it is a sensitivity to life
    - notice details you couldnt tell before
    - “Attention, taken to its highest degree, is the same thing as prayer. It presupposes love and faith. Absolutely unmixed attention is prayer.” – Simone Weil        
- over time, just like how we anneal metal, our taste becomes more refined and we are more sure in what feels optimal to us
- have good taste so you can learn to attend to the world
	- Some of the infinite detail and beauty of reality reveals itself to you, and you’re able to distinguish the ones that differ moment to moment.

- ira glass on good taste
	- “Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”
