Taste is something that goes by many names: intuition, conviction, aesthetics. It's hard to draw an exact boundary around what taste itself actually encompasses but I'll define it roughly as the ability to -- almost instinctively -- _feel_ the difference between what you find 'good' or 'bad'.

Taste in this sense of the word is often dismissed as subjective. When we lack the words to make legible our thought processes behind why we prefer this mug over that one, we ultimately call that taste. It's raw, emotionally charged, and biased. How could it have any place in rational decision making?

It turns out that carving out your own [[iconic space]] involves developing an incredibly refined sense of _personal_ taste. What feels good to you? What questions are worth asking? These questions, well pointed, can help us live fuller, more fulfilled lives.

What follows is a collection of notes around taste, what it is good for and how to cultivate it.



- what is it good for
	- we should cultivate our taste because it is a power of judgement we need to live well
	- extending judgement of whats good or bad beyond what other people have thought
		- school has taught one framework for whats valuable
		- work teaches another
		- academia teaches yet another
	- without a well-developed independent taste
		- your value systems are completely dictated by others
		- your self-worth is dictated by how much you can justify your work and values within the context of the taste of others
		- end up in situations where one is always 'behind' and 'catching up'
	- e.g. in research
		- digression to research -- research is actually a great analogy for how to live life
			- knowing what the right questions to pursue
			- taste is the ability to know _what_ the good questions to ask are and to have conviction that they are the right questions to ask.
		- Kuhn pointed out, the biggest ideas [transcend the existing paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift) and create their own lane.
		- people with strong taste create their own possibilities for what is possible, outside what other people believe
		- in research brilliance often isn't only about the ability to execute and solve problems (though thats important too)
			- > When [Grothendieck] writes that his peers were more brilliant than him, he is referring to their ability to *answer* questions. It was just that their questions were unoriginal. (Henrik Karlsson, [Good Ideas](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/good-ideas))
			- the best researchers are not the most technical ones but rather the best at knowing what types of questions to ask and answer
		- it's also good to look at the history of scientific freedom for more evidence as to why research direction shouldn't always be managed
			- Managed creativity can, at best, produce only what its managers specify.
			- Creativity is the essence of the human spirit, and flowers best when it's unconstrained. If you try to control it for your own ends you must learn that you can get only what you ask for. The unexpected will not arise.
	- epistemic traps
		- look at this from the perspective of epistemics 
		- Intellectual playfulness, loosely, is the disposition to try out new ideas, perspectives and systems of thought (involves perspective shifting) for the sheer joy of it. It is a disposition to explore ideas for the value of exploration itself.
		- Intellectual playfulness also has some clear epistemic functionality for us
			- intellectually playful exploration sometimes can better serve the goal of finding the truth, than will exploration that is strictly aimed at finding the truth
			- it functions against epistemic traps: belief systems that undermine our epistemic efforts, leaving us stuck inside them
			- The truth-seeker’s explorations are guided by the current belief system; they will typically check out the most plausible alternatives. The intellectually playful person doesn’t care about plausibility. They care about more aesthetic qualities of ideas. They care about cool ideas, or elegant ones, or thrilling joy-rides of discovery. They care about exploring where exploration is joyful.
				- First, an interest in getting it right constrains the search space, focusing searches on areas which promise good epistemic yields. Suppose that you are perspective-shifting, not for autotelic reasons, but in the pursuit of truth. You are searching the possibility space for ideas you might have missed. Your perspective shifts will likely be guided by your sense of which shifts will be epistemically fruitful. Since you are interested in the truth, you’ll try on those alternate systems of belief which might turn out to be true. Your shifts will be constrained by your sense of plausibility. And that assessment will proceed from your standing system of beliefs. Even if you are trying out alternative systems of belief, the choice of those systems will still be influenced by your standing system of beliefs.
				- So the right thing to do is to sometimes go on random walks — to explore idea unconstrained by the need to optimize for truth every step along the way. And, he says, we have a name for the tendency to go on a reasonable number of random walks: we call it “creativity” (Currie, 2019).
			- play -- by nature is opposed to strict rule boundedness
				- involves a lightness of rules
		- An effective hill-climber is one that sometimes goes in the wrong-direction! (see also: [[thoughts/exploit explore]])
			- Attempts to optimize for truth will help climb a local maxima, but are likely to miss higher peaks that are radically different.
			- random walks are _actually good_
			- As Sara Aronowitz says, the optimally rational being — or community of beings — mostly pursues the best-looking most plausible paths for exploration, but occasionally goes on random walks
	- well-developed taste is conviction
		- helps you avoid power seeking + optionality
			- https://ftlsid.com/How+to+be/On+seeking+power
			- > Power is seductive because it is maximally general; seeking power is the ultimate way of saying "I don't know what I want." (and so you look for the meta-ability to get whatever you want, instead of seeking concrete things)
			- > In my experience, as I've come to know what I want, I've started to value power less and less. It's obviously useful to be well-connected, and to be able to convey your ideas and requests to relevant people. But power beyond those basics is the goal of a flat, empty, undeveloped person.
		- great ideas are easy to kill so having conviction is important
	- any act of creation necessarily involves strong opinions about how the world should work
- how to cultivate your taste
	- how might one develop [[iconic space]] for themselves
		- Good ideas — actually, no, *great* ideas are fragile. Great ideas are easy to kill. An idea in its larval stage — all the best ideas when I first heard them sound bad.
		- What solitude gives you is an opportunity to study *what personal curiosity feels like* in its undiluted form, free from the interference of other considerations (Good Ideas, [Henrik Karlsson](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/good-ideas))
		- but solitude doesn't necessarily need to be in the physical and social sense
		- [Grothendieck] could interface with the mathematical community with integrity because he had a deep familiarity with his inner space. If he had not known the shape of his interests and aims, he would have been more vulnerable to the standards and norms of the community.
		- sufficiently developed taste lets us interfacing with others as potential sparks of inspiration rather than the prime directive for what to believe in
	- by definition it is yours
	- Each day is an exercise in developing taste. That’s all life is really—a giant sequence of decisions.
	- Taste is built over time through repeated applications. It requires intention, focus, and care. It’s a process of peeling back layer after layer, turning over rock after rock. It is the manifestation of [[thoughts/self-confidence]] in what we find beautiful and aesthetic.
	- do things without recipes more often
	- trod the unbeaten path more often and take note of how things feel
	- Curiosity and an inherent observatory nature toward the world serve as constant opportunities to test your taste. The process of cultivating taste is a lot like the writing and editing process. George Saunders on the revision process:
	- > “The way I revise is: I read my own text and imagine a little meter in my head, with “P” on one side (“Positive”) and “N” on the other (“Negative”)... This involves making thousands of what I’ve come to think of as “micro-decisions.” These are instantaneous, intuitive – I just prefer this to that… I just have a feeling and react to that feeling, in the form of a cut phrase, or an added word, or an urge to move this whole section, and so on. And then I do that over and over, for months, sometimes years, until that needle stays up in the “P” zone for the whole length of the text…With each choice, even the smallest ones, the story becomes more and more…well, it becomes more her, you could say. There’s more of her essential nature in it, more of what will distinguish her from all of those other writers out there. And gradually, the story starts to become something she couldn’t have foreseen when she started out – bigger, more complex, smarter, funnier, whatever.”
	- at this point, you don't need to maximize for novelty
		- it is ok to unknowingly repeat existing work 
		- actually useful because then it is no longer
