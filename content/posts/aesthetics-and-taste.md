## In research
- In independent research, one often pendulums between two brains that drive your day-to-day
  1.  Brain 1: I want to make change in the world, I want to ship and build
      - This is the beginners mind, it helps you escape the conceptual walls of today's dogma.
      - Kuhn pointed out, the biggest ideas [transcend the existing paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift) and create their own lane.
  2.  Brain 2: I want to _understand_ why this works the way it does
      - It is almost always Brain 2 thinking that leads to incredibly high payoffs in clarity and increased conviction.
- Often times, it is one core principle that if followed to its natural conclusion/end will result in a fundamental perspective shift (e.g. quantum mechanics).
- the best researchers are not the most technical ones but rather the best at knowing what types of questions to ask and answer
- quote: I don't think one's research needs solve anything, just notice something new.
- cant force research direction (see [[thoughts/Scientific Freedom|Scientific Freedom]])
- epistemic play
	- Don't get trapped in the mindset of having every little thing you do fit perfectly in your grand master plan. An effective hill-climber is one that sometimes goes in the wrong-direction! (see also: [[thoughts/exploit explore]])

## Against epistemic traps
Intellectual playfulness, loosely, is the disposition to try out new ideas, perspectives and systems of thought (involves perspective shifting) for the sheer joy of it ([[thoughts/The Grasshopper, Games, Life and Utopia#Terminology|autotelic behaviour]]). It is a disposition to explore ideas for the value of exploration itself. ^81b0a0

Intellectual playfulness also has some clear epistemic functionality for us

- intellectually playful exploration sometimes can better serve the goal of finding the truth, than will exploration that is strictly aimed at finding the truth
- it functions against epistemic traps: belief systems that undermine our epistemic efforts, leaving us stuck inside them

In the [[thoughts/exploit explore|exploit-explore tradeoff]], random walks are _actually good_. Surely, one may argue, that if going on occasional random walks is the best path for rationality, then wouldn't the rational person go on random walks? Yet, one cannot take a truly random walk without being guided by prior beliefs.

## Great ideas are easy to kill
- What solitude gives you is an opportunity to study *what personal curiosity feels like* in its undiluted form, free from the interference of other considerations (Good Ideas, [Henrik Karlsson](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/good-ideas))
	- Good ideas — actually, no, *great* ideas are fragile. Great ideas are easy to kill. An idea in its larval stage — all the best ideas when I first heard them sound bad.
	- [Grothendieck] could interface with the mathematical community with integrity because he had a deep familiarity with his inner space. If he had not known the shape of his interests and aims, he would have been more vulnerable to the standards and norms of the community—at least he seems to think so.
	- Pascal, self-teaching mathematics because his father did not approve, rederived several Euclidean proofs. There is also a lot of confusion and pursuit of dead ends. Newton looking for numerical patterns in the Bible, for instance. This might look wasteful if you think what they are doing is research. But it is not if you realize that they are building up their ability to perceive the evolution of their own thought, their capacity for [[thoughts/attention|attention]].
