Taste is something that goes by many names: intuition, conviction, self-trust, aesthetics. It's hard to draw an exact boundary around what taste itself actually encompasses but I'll define it roughly as the ability to -- almost instinctively -- _feel_ the difference between what you find 'good' or 'bad'. 

The feeling of finding something in accordance with our personal taste is a deep, almost ineffable, feeling of simplicity and underlying harmony that we may feel before we understand or can make legible why. Often, what we find deeply beautiful or aesthetic is our way of saying "this is good but I don't have the words to make legible the why."

This instinct is almost always ruled out of any 'serious' sense making *due* to this subjectivity. But if we look to history, we'll see that almost all deeply novel or creative work involves a subjective sense of beauty or aesthetics.

Leonhard Euler intuited the existence of his namesake identity $e^{i\pi}+1=0$ through the beauty and elegance that sat at the intersection of Taylor series, the unit circle, and imaginary numbers. It has since become a fundamental result in complex analysis.

Annie Dillard relates a tale from a fellow writer who was asked by a student:

> "Do you think I could be a writer?"
>
> "Well," the writer said, "I don't know... Do you like sentences?"
>
> The writer could see the student's amazement. Sentences? Do I liked sentences? I am twenty years old and do I like sentences? If he had liked sentences, of course, he could begin, like a joyful painter I knew. I asked him how he came to be a painter. He said, "I liked the smell of paint"
> 
> If you’re going to be a gardener, it helps to like the smell of roses. If you’re going to be a writer, it helps to appreciate sentences. That, however, only happens once you’ve spent many afternoons reading.

Dmitri Mendeleev wasn't the first to try to organize the elements into some sense of order. However, while trying to organize all the existing elements in terms of atomic weight, he found a curious pattern where certain types and properties of elements occurred regularly (i.e. a reactive non-metal was directly followed by a very reactive light metal and then a less reactive light metal). Rather than massaging his newfound table of elements to match science's knowledge of the elements, he let the beauty of the table leave gaps, predicting the existence of yet-to-be discovered elements like Gallium (which he called eka-aluminium), Scandium and Germanium.

Taste, it seems, is a good heuristic for non-obvious optimality. It's non-obvious because what is optimal isn't always legible. In fact, this illegibility is often *necessary* for novel work that breaks out of existing paradigms.

The space of illegible ideas affords a certain lightness as to how they are held; one can try ideas on for size without needing to immediately jump to explain it to others. C Thi. Nguyen calls this a form of *[[thoughts/Jestermaxxing|intellectual playfulness]]*: a disposition to try out new ideas, perspectives and systems of thought (involves perspective shifting) for the sheer joy of it. It is a disposition to explore ideas for the value of exploration itself. It turns out that this intellectual playfulness or *lightness of ideas* actually has some clear [[thoughts/epistemology|epistemic]] functionality for us.

It helps us to escape epistemic traps where existing value systems beliefs may make us shut down a line of questioning before exploring its validity. Nguyen calls these epistemic traps: belief systems that re-directs good-faith inquiry to bad results. An epistemic trap manipulates background beliefs to fend off contrary evidence. For example, echo chambers are a type of epistemic trap in which a community which creates a significant [[thoughts/trust|trust]] disparity between members and non-members, leading members to dismiss any and all contrary evidence coming in from the outside.

It turns out that this playful attitude towards knowledge may actually help us find more 'optimal' knowledge than a pure truth-seeker might. An interest in getting it right constrains the search space, focusing searches on plausible paths to explore and discarding what is implausible or beyond the pale. However, this assessment of plausibility will proceed from your standing system of beliefs so even 'rational' epistemic attempts will be captured by a well-wrought epistemic trap.

Similarly, Alexandre Grothendieck thought that a fear of being wrong functioned as a form of epistemic trap, causing our thoughts and ideas to calcify.

> "One who fears to be wrong is powerless to discover. It is when we are afraid of making mistakes that the mistake inside us becomes immovable like a rock. Because in our fear, we cling to what we have decreed to be “true”, or what has always been presented to us as “true”. If we are moved, not by the fear of seeing an illusory security vanish, but by a thirst for knowing, then error, like suffering or sorrow, will cross us without ever becoming frozen, and the trace of its passage will be a renewed understanding."

On the other hand, an intellectually playful person doesn’t care about plausibility. They care about more aesthetic qualities of ideas. They care about cool ideas, or elegant ones, or thrilling joy-rides of discovery. They care about exploring where exploration is joyful. So the right thing to do is to sometimes go on random walks in idea space -- to explore idea unconstrained by the need to optimize for truth every step along the way. And, he says, we have a name for the tendency to go on a reasonable number of random walks: we call it "creativity" or "taste.

We grow up going to school which teaches us a framework for what is valuable: being excellent at following rubrics, saying what others want to hear, and rote memorization without inquiry. Academic teaches us another: citations are indicative of how novel or impactful your work is, results matter more than the process. Work teaches us yet another: what makes us money is what is worth your time, your value as a person is tied to the work you output and the money you make.

These aren't inherently bad frameworks to live by. In fact, some might argue that these are good value systems to live by because they are decent approximations of what fulfilling and meaningful work might look like for people who haven't chosen to develop that taste for themselves. However, like with anything mediating, they serve as band-pass filters -- killing off the worst ideas but also the best ones (because they too are outside of the [[thoughts/Overton Window|Overton Window]]).

The crux is that as we grow through these various stages of life, we jerk and mold ourselves into the various value systems, contorting the narratives we tell ourselves to fit what others tell us we should value. Our self-worth is dictated by how much you can justify your work and values within the context of the taste of others and we end up in situations where one is always 'behind' and 'catching up.' In what world is a game of constant catch-up fulfilling?

As we outsource our opinions all the time, we no longer exercise our own taste and lose the capacity to derive our own value systems. Like a muscle, it decays without frequent use and we default to liking and valuing what everyone around us already likes or does.

Having strong taste -- a deep seated conviction -- helps to create their own possibilities for what is possible, outside what other people believe, relying on their intrinsic, subjective judgement of what feels correct. Truly groundbreaking work requires the capacity to *go beyond the context they were raised in.*

If we look to history of [[thoughts/Scientific Freedom|scientific progress]], we see plenty of evidence that relying exclusively on the opinions of others for what is worthwhile to pursue only inhibits progress. Managed creativity can, at best, produce only what its managers specify.

Vannevar Bush: "scientific progress on a broad front results from the free play of free intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown." 

Creativity is the essence of the human spirit, and flowers best when it's unconstrained. If you try to control it for your own ends you must learn that you can get only what you ask for and nothing more.

Thomas Kuhn pointed out that the biggest ideas [transcend the existing paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift) and create their own lane. In research, brilliance often isn't only about the ability to execute and solve problems (though that's important too). The best researchers are often not the most technical but rather the best at *knowing what types of questions to ask and answer.*

>  "It is not so much, it seems to me, a so-called “brain power” that makes the difference between this mathematician and another, or between one piece of work and another of a same mathematician; but rather the quality of finesse, of the greater or lesser delicacy of this openness or sensitivity, from one researcher to another or from one moment to another in the same researcher. The most profound and fruitful work is also that which attests to the most delicate sensitivity in apprehending the hidden beauty of things."

In this vein, we've seen many aphorisms in the realm of Pablo Picasso's "Without great solitude, no serious work is possible" and James Baldwin's "Perhaps the primary distinction of the artist is that he must actively cultivate that state which most men, necessarily, must avoid: the state of being alone."

In practice, however, what they are referring to as solitude is not being physically isolated but rather more of a state of mind. They are putting themselves in a state where the opinions of others do not bother them and where they reach a heightened sensitivity for the types of questions worth asking -- they've developed their taste[^1].

[^1]: Though this *has* some historical precedence for happening through physical isolation (e.g. Newton, Grothendieck, Pascal, Baldwin), I largely believe the lone genius myth is false. The lone genius is a proxy for being a hard worker but it isn't the only way of doing [[posts/pain-and-great-work|great work]].

This critical developmental period is almost always in environments where there is little to no pressure to conform to existing frameworks of thinking. They didn't worry themselves with what was novel or unexplored, but rather what was beautiful and interesting. Often, this leads to repeating work that may already have been done (like Einstein reinventing parts of statistical physics or Grothendieck working out his own formal definitions for length). But by the time they *did* hit novel territory or the bounds of human knowledge, it no longer mattered to them because they just kept doing what they were already doing. They did not seek the safety of knowing or the safety of a legible question, but were okay with lingering in the depths of illegibility until something deeper, more unifying, arose.

> "Creation is the act of bringing something nonexistent into reality. You have to have strong opinions about how the world should work. You have to think that things should be a certain way, that you prefer this color over that, this form of walking over another, this sense of beauty over theirs, this way of approaching the world over some other. Taste gives you the capability and the urgency to imagine."

Well-developed taste is conviction. Great ideas are easy to kill. An idea in its infancy is easy to prod, poke, and find holes in. Of course they are; we generally evaluate ideas relative to the existing paradigm or ways of thinking. 

Any act of creation necessarily involves strong opinions about how the world should work -- strong enough to survive the sharp edges of doubt and the false allure of safety in what is known and what has been done.

Sufficiently developed taste gives us the conviction that lets us interface with others as potential sparks of inspiration rather than the prime directive for what to believe in.

How might we cultivate our taste?

Quoting Voltaire: "In order to have taste, it is not enough to see and to know what is beautiful in a given work. One must feel beauty and be moved by it." The world reveals itself to those who attend to it.

Each day is an exercise in developing taste. That’s all life is really -- a giant sequence of decisions. Taste is built over time through repeated applications. It requires intention, focus, and care. It’s a process of peeling back layer after layer, turning over rock after rock. It is the manifestation of [[thoughts/self-confidence]] in what we find beautiful and aesthetic. And in making these decisions, you choose to pay attention to different aspects of your lived experience and, with time, 

Do things without recipes more often. Trod the unbeaten path more often and take note of how things feel.

Curiosity and an inherent observatory nature toward the world serve as constant opportunities to test your taste. The process of cultivating taste is a lot like the writing and editing process.

And then I do that over and over, for months, sometimes years, until that needle stays up in the “P” zone for the whole length of the text...

Your taste is by definition yours. Hone it and then learn to trust it.
