*John Reeve (1958-61, 1966)*

Taste goes by many names: intuition, conviction, self-trust, aesthetics. Roughly, it is the ability to make judgements about aesthetic value; to instinctively tell the difference between what is beautiful or not.

It turns out that beyond the usually positive connotations of having 'good taste' when it comes to food, art, or media, it is also instrumentally useful in finding what is meaningful and worthwhile to spend our lives on.

In research, brilliance often isn't only about the ability to execute and solve problems (though that's important too). The best researchers are the best at *knowing what types of questions to ask and answer* -- they have good research taste.

The most profound and fruitful work is also that which attests to the most delicate sensitivity in apprehending the hidden beauty of things."

Though Grothendieck refers to math here, I think the observation generalizes. There is this thread through many different disciplines where a pursuit of the craft because you find it inherently _beautiful_ -- to like it in and of itself -- reveals a deeper, more fundamental understanding.

For any creative pursuit, this ability to notice more deeply is what distinguishes good from great. It is a form of attention that starts to reveal the infinite depth of the world. This is how you will begin to notice nuances you hadn’t seen before. You begin to see wider and deeper.

Annie Dillard relates a tale from a fellow writer who was asked a question by a student:

> "Do you think I could be a writer?"
>
> "Well," the writer said, "I don't know... Do you like sentences?"
>
> The writer could see the student's amazement. Sentences? Do I liked sentences? I am twenty years old and do I like sentences? If he had liked sentences, of course, he could begin, like a joyful painter I knew. I asked him how he came to be a painter. He said, "I liked the smell of paint"
> 
> If you’re going to be a gardener, it helps to like the smell of roses. If you’re going to be a writer, it helps to appreciate sentences. That, however, only happens once you’ve spent many afternoons reading.

If taste is knowing what is beautiful, then taste serves as a guide that gives us hints as to what is worthwhile; what to keep and what to toss.

Taste is a particularly _good_ guide for answering the question of "what is worthwhile" because we've normalized taste as a sort of ineffable, subjective thing.

When I find the craftsman ship of one mug I make more aesthetic than another, I'm not expected to justify it to myself that the walls are slightly more even or that the glaze fired slightly more blue on the other. I'd like to think that I've started to develop a palette for what personally feels and looks good in pottery. I really like sharp walls that are slightly tapered outwards. They shouldn't be too thin or the piece will feel flimsy and fragile but it also shouldn't be too heavy enough or it will feel like a heavy rock in your hand. I particularly like more speckled clay bodies that are more earthy and warm in tone paired with slightly cooler glazes. The ones I've been really enjoying as of late are double layered ones with a creamy white base layer and a beautiful layer of celadon overtop. Sometimes, you can hear a faint tinkling when they are fresh out of the furnace as the glaze contracts and forms beautiful internal cracking patterns.

I have very explicitly avoided trying to define my taste of pottery in terms of specific styles or potters. I know that if I did feel that pressure, I would have spent a lot more time learning and reading about various pottery techniques, the names of different forms, and what glazes have been popular on social media.

- How I focus on pottery would purely be in terms of what has historically been done. I would think about the shape of the walls insofar as it produces the right shape that I see other people make.
	- The extent of my experience with pottery would all be with the intention of being able to emulate what has been done before.
	- we have built up an instinctive habit of looking things up and seeing how other people have done it before trying it for ourselves
	- doing so primes your brain to value your work in the context of the taste of others rather than of your own
		- that is, we have outsourced our value systems for what is good/bad (how we may judge aesthetic value) to other people
	- As we outsource our opinions all the time, we no longer exercise our own taste and lose the capacity to derive our own value systems. Like a muscle, it decays without frequent use and we default to liking and valuing what everyone around us already likes or does.
	- and thus you will only do what has come before and has been repeated
	- However, like with anything mediating, they serve as band-pass filters -- killing off the worst ideas but also the best ones
		- kills anything outside the [[thoughts/Overton Window|Overton Window]]
- If we look to history of [[thoughts/Scientific Freedom|scientific progress]], we see plenty of evidence that relying exclusively on the opinions of others for what is worthwhile to pursue only inhibits progress. Managed creativity can, at best, produce only what its managers specify.
	- Thomas Kuhn pointed out that the biggest ideas [transcend the existing paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift) and create their own lane.
	- Vannevar Bush: "scientific progress on a broad front results from the free play of free intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown." 
	- Creativity is the essence of the human spirit, and flowers best when it's unconstrained. If you try to control it for your own ends you must learn that you can get only what you ask for and nothing more.
- if you want to do truly original work, 
	- Having strong taste -- a deep seated conviction -- helps to create their own possibilities for what is possible, outside what other people believe, relying on their intrinsic, subjective judgement of what feels correct. Truly groundbreaking work requires the capacity to *go beyond the context they were raised in.*
- at its heart, to do something new and lively requires the ability to hold what Simone Weil called negative attention
	- [[thoughts/Simone Weil|Simone Weil]] believed that the way which you direct your [[thoughts/attention|attention]] drastically influences _how_ you experience the world. To attend means not to seek, but to wait; not to concentrate, but instead to dilate our minds. We do not gain insights, Weil claims, by going in search of them, but instead by waiting for them.
		- "Above all our thought should be empty [_vide_], waiting [_en attente_], not seeking anything [_ne rien chercher_], but ready to receive in its naked truth the object that is to penetrate it."
	- The French makes more clear the connection between attention (_l’attention_) and waiting (_attente_). For Weil the problem with searching, instead of waiting, is precisely that one is eager to fill the void characterizing _attente_. As a result, one settles too quickly on some-thing: a counterfeit, falsity, idol.
	- paying attention surfaces things we otherwise wouldn't be aware of 
- similar to nguyens playfulness vs epistemic traps
	- These traps manipulate background beliefs to fend off contrary evidence. Echo chambers, for example, creates a significant [[thoughts/trust|trust]] disparity between members and non-members, leading members to dismiss any and all contrary evidence coming in from the outside. 
	- One example is the tendency to settle on what is popular
		- these false idols
	- Similarly, Alexandre Grothendieck thought that a fear of being wrong was also a type of epistemic trap.
		- > "One who fears to be wrong is powerless to discover. It is when we are afraid of making mistakes that the mistake inside us becomes immovable like a rock. Because in our fear, we cling to what we have decreed to be “true”, or what has always been presented to us as “true”. If we are moved, not by the fear of seeing an illusory security vanish, but by a thirst for knowing, then error, like suffering or sorrow, will cross us without ever becoming frozen, and the trace of its passage will be a renewed understanding." > -- Alexandre Grothendieck, *[[thoughts/Alexandre Grothendieck#Reflection and testimony on a past as a mathematician|Récoltes et Semailles]] (translation by Childe)*
	- C Thi. Nguyen calls this lightness of ideas *[[thoughts/Jestermaxxing|intellectual playfulness]]*. When an intellectually playful person evaluates new ideas, they don't care about plausibility or legibility. They care about cool ideas, or elegant ones, or thrilling joy-rides of discovery. They care about exploring where exploration is joyful.
	- Nguyen argues that this intellectual playfulness or *lightness of ideas* actually has some clear [[thoughts/epistemology|epistemic]] functionality for us. A pure 'truth-seeker' has an interest in always getting it right. This attitude constrains the search space, focusing searches on plausible paths to explore and discarding what is implausible or beyond the pale. However, because their assessment of plausibility will always proceed from their standing system of beliefs, even their most rational epistemic attempts can be caught in what Nguyen calls an epistemic trap: belief systems that make us shut down a line of questioning before exploring its validity.
- highlights that what is worthwhile isn't always immediately legible
	- as we've seen, what appears to the 'optimal' or 'right' thing to work on according to the taste of others may end up in these epistemic traps
	- and so ineffability via play (i.e. non-goal oriented play) helps us avoid these traps
		- a thread with a lot of early revolutionary thinkers is that didn't worry themselves with what was 'optimal', but rather what was beautiful and interesting.
		- Often, this leads to repeating work that may already have been done (like Einstein reinventing parts of statistical physics or Grothendieck working out his own formal definitions for length).
		- by the time they *did* hit novel territory or the bounds of human knowledge, it no longer mattered to them because they just kept doing what they were already doing.
		- They did not seek the safety of knowing or the safety of a legible question, but were okay with lingering in the depths of illegibility until something deeper, more unifying, arose.
		- The 'right' thing to do is to sometimes go on random walks in idea space -- to explore idea unconstrained by the need to optimize for truth every step along the way. 
	- This ineffability affords a certain lightness to how one might hold ideas and knowledge. It lets us try ideas on for size without needing to immediately jump to explain it to others.
	- These nascent moments when you are exploring something that is new, trying to coerce it in terms of what we already know or what is palatable to others is actively harmful to developing your own taste.
- it turns out, Great ideas are easy to kill. An idea in its infancy is easy to prod, poke, and find holes in. Of course they are; we generally evaluate ideas relative to the existing paradigm or ways of thinking. 
	- Well-developed taste is conviction.
	- Any act of creation necessarily involves strong opinions about how the world should work -- strong enough to survive the sharp edges of doubt and the false allure of safety in what is known and what has been done.
	- > "Creation is the act of bringing something nonexistent into reality. You have to have strong opinions about how the world should work. You have to think that things should be a certain way, that you prefer this color over that, this form of walking over another, this sense of beauty over theirs, this way of approaching the world over some other. Taste gives you the capability and the urgency to imagine." -- Spencer Chang, *[creative seeing](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/creative-seeing)*
- this is often mistaken as the lone genius
	- We've seen many aphorisms in the realm of Pablo Picasso's "Without great solitude, no serious work is possible" and James Baldwin's "Perhaps the primary distinction of the artist is that he must actively cultivate that state which most men, necessarily, must avoid: the state of being alone."
	- In practice, however, what they are referring to as solitude is not being physically isolated but rather more of a state of mind. They are putting themselves in a state where the opinions of others do not bother them and where they reach a heightened sensitivity for the types of questions worth asking -- they've developed their taste[^2].
	- strong taste doesn't say "don't ever look to others for inspiration" and to ignore what others are working on
		- but rather, look to others for inspiration to helps you attend to things you otherwise would not have noticed and to bring more things into your periphery
		- but never evaluate the merit of a thing solely based on the opinions of others
		- it is a supplement not a replacement
	- Sufficiently developed taste gives us the conviction that lets us interface with others as potential sparks of inspiration rather than the prime directive for what to believe in.
- How might we cultivate our taste?
	- Quoting Voltaire: "In order to have taste, it is not enough to see and to know what is beautiful in a given work. One must feel beauty and be moved by it." The world reveals itself to those who attend to it.
	- Each day is an exercise in developing taste. That’s all life is really -- a giant sequence of decisions. Taste is built over time through repeated applications. It requires intention, focus, and care. It’s a process of peeling back layer after layer, turning over rock after rock. It is the manifestation of [[thoughts/self-confidence]] in what we find beautiful and aesthetic. 
	- Do things without recipes more often. Trod the unbeaten path more often and take note of how things feel.
	- Curiosity and an inherent observatory nature toward the world serve as constant opportunities to test your taste.
	- The process of cultivating taste is a lot like the writing and editing process.

- over time, just like how we anneal metal, our taste becomes more refined and we are more sure in what feels optimal to us
- crafted well, taste gives us the tools to have more [[thoughts/agency|agency]] over our own lives and how we define meaning
	- what greater thing could there be to cultivate?

[^2]: Though this *has* some historical precedence for happening through physical isolation (e.g. Newton, Grothendieck, Pascal, Baldwin), I largely believe the lone genius myth is false. The lone genius is a proxy for being a hard worker but it isn't the only way of doing [[posts/pain-and-great-work|great work]].
