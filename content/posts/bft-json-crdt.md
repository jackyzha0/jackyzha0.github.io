- reliable causal broadcast
-  This doesn't mean that conflict doesn't ever occur, but we are able to always determine the output up front, based on a metadata contained within the structure itself.

- [[thoughts/State Machine Replication (SMR)|state machine replication]] is hard
	- traditional consensus needs (tbd) rounds of communication, making it infeasible for real-time communication
		- "When application state is replicated across the globe, developers often face stark choices regarding replica consistency. Strong consistency can be enforced in a general-purpose way at the storage or memory layer via classical distributed coordination (consensus, transactions, etc.), but this is often unattractive for latency and availability reasons. Alternatively, application developers can build on “weakly” consistent storage models that do not use coordination; in this case developers must reason about consistency at the application level"
	- acid vs base
	- [[thoughts/CRDT]]s allow us to achieve that (with some caveats)
- understanding crdts
	- we know that most transport algorithms guarantee ordering, so why do we need CRDTs?
	- well, imagine a TCP connection
		- it works for two people communicating directly with each other
		- but as soon as you have 3 people, 
	- why we need them
		- positional updates are not commutative
		- but attaching unique ids enables this to happen!
	- we can encode causal dependencies by tracking causal parent (origin field)
	- another problem: how do you order things with the same origin? we need a sense of time. we need clocks!
		- lamport clocks to the rescue
		- not time in the traditional sense, but logical sense
	- imagine a 'time frontier'
		- fancy terminology: hasse diagram
		- if we receive anything that isn't the very next update we are expecting, we can queue it up for later
		- this is a more complex form of [[thoughts/TCP]]s windowing technique
	- automerge
		- underlying algorithm is RGA
			-   Build the tree, connecting each item to its parent
			-   When an item has multiple children, sort them by sequence number then by their ID.
			-   The resulting list (or text document) can be made by flattening the tree with a depth-first traversal.
		- potential optimizations
			- yjs uses a doubly-linked list for faster insert + a cursor to track last visited position
				- assumes that editing patterns are *not* random (which is true for most applications due)
			- diamond-types (josephg) and the new automerge uses a b-tree for even faster insert + find
	- limitations
		- [[thoughts/CALM Theorem]]: can't really circumvent this without synchronization
			- as a result, no garbage collection
			- not a replacement for traditional consensus, just a specific subset
			- projects like BLOOM try to exploit this
		- byzantine fault tolerance ... up until now
- adding byzantine fault tolerance
	- allow us to use CRDTs in untrusted/permissionless environments! huge win
	- traditionally up until $f < \frac n 3$ as per [[thoughts/33% Impossibility Result]], most blockchains tout this
	- but we can get a stronger property of $f  < n$
	- what does BFT mean in this context?
		- different from BFT in a consensus context
		- consensus is notably different from collaborative algorithms like CRDTs
			- consensus focuses on choosing one correct value
				- footnote: if you want this behaviour, you can use supermajority quorums like what Tendermind and PBFT do
			- collaborative algorithms focus on converging to a correct state while attempting to preserve everyone's intentions
		- a byzantine actor can attempt to
			- send malformed updates
			- attempt to DDOS the network
			- not forward information from honest nodes (eclipse attack)
			- send invalid updates
				- messages that have duplicate IDs
				- send incorrect sequence numbers (equivocation attack)
				- 'forge' updates from another user
		- we want to prevent these from causing state divergence
		- however, this means that byzantine actors can still send a bunch of 'valid' updates that may be unwanted
		- imagine you sent a Google Docs link to a group of people
			- one of them is mucking around and inserting a bunch of images and removing information
			- these are all 'valid' operations as what everyone sees on their screen is still the same thing

		- a P2P system cannot rely on nodes always behaving the way that the designers of the system intended
		- In some circumstances, the lack of Byzantine fault tolerance can be justified by restricting CRDT-based collaboration to small, trusted groups of nodes: for example, in a collaborative editor, the set of users who are authorised to edit a document may be limited to immediate colleagues, who may trust each other to run the CRDT algorithm correctly

		- We also conjecture that there is only one operation-based CRDT design supporting noncommutative operations that fulfills SEC in Byzantine environments with any number of faults.
		- Operation-based CRDTs that provide inherent identity and inherent ordering of operations are equivocation-tolerant
		- The happened-before relation being a partial order inherently leads to a directed, acyclic graph of all operations.
		- A hash-chained directed acyclic graph as described in, is the only operation-based CRDT with non-commutative operations that provides SEC for any number of Byzantine faults, i.e., has fault tolerance n > f.
	- hash graph + signed message digests -> can no longer fake operations
		- technically this is enough if every node is connected to each other
	- ensuring eventual delivery (basically, [[thoughts/message broadcast#Causal Broadcast]])
		- [[thoughts/Byzantine Broadcast]] (we can actually get away with weaker requirements here)
			- dont need total order broadcast, just causal broadcast
		- Eager reliable broadcast: first time a node receives a message, re-broadcast to each other node
			- on receiving an 'out of order' message, save it in a queue until it is ready
			- occasionally retry
		- potential optimizations
			- Reliable but expensive! $O(n^2)$ messages for $n$ nodes
			- consider the worst case scenario where all the honest nodes are in a line
			- we can reformulate this problem kind of like pull requests where nodes ask for updates from other nodes periodically
			- 
	- the cool part is that we don't need to modify the underlying CRDT itself, it can be fully retrofit on top of it
		- we can create a 'bft adapter' layer between the transport and application layer that is responsible
		- modify two places
			- generating IDs for operations
			- checking if an operation is valid
- finally, a word of warning on the safety of building applications on top of CRDTs
	- difference between view and the model
	- One might say that CRDTs provide Schrödinger consistency guarantees: they are guaranteed to be consistent only if they are not viewed.

- making it JSON
	- difficult because data types can change
	- example
		- think about A assigning a key a as a list and adds b as an element
		- B assigns a key as a map and adds an entry c
		- how do we resolve this?
