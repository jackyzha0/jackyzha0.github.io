- what is worthwhile? meditations on pain and doing great work
- whiplash asks the question “what is worthwhile”
    - pursuing what you are naturally good at vs forcing yourself to do something you think is good
        - probably tied to scientific freedom/taste argument
            - TK
        - "You're incredibly gifted, Sam. But it is worth noting that to be good at something is not quite the same as loving it."
    - how much great work has gone undeveloped because we didnt push someone hard enough?
        - fletcher in the movie implies that we lose a lot because of this
        - but what actually happens to neuman? he’ll likely fucking lose it in 30 years and turn into fletcher
            - will he be good at what he does? probably
            - will he be fulfilled? no
                - making time for relationships
            - fletcher prays on neuman feeling inadequate, constantly moving the goal posts making it impossible for fletcher to be truly actually pleased
            - fletcher has no regard for the actual people hes bullying, just respect for the craft
        - can truly great work be done while fueled by desire to prove oneself?
            - TK
        - i’ve had the unfortunate pleasure of having a fletcher-like personality in my own life
            - how has this shaped me as a person?
            - TK
    - can obsession ever be healthy?
