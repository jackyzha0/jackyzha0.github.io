- whiplash asks the question “what is worthwhile”
	- pursuing what you are naturally good at vs forcing yourself to do something you think is good
		- probably tied to scientific freedom/taste argument
			- [[posts/aesthetics-and-taste|aesthetics-and-taste]]
	- "You're incredibly gifted, Sam. But it is worth noting that to be good at something is not quite the same as loving it."
		- [[thoughts/Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow|Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow]]
- how much great work has gone undeveloped because we didnt push someone hard enough?
	- fletcher in the movie implies that we lose a lot because of this
	- but what actually happens to neuman? he’ll likely fucking lose it in 30 years and turn into fletcher or kill himself like sean casey
		- will he be good at what he does? probably
		- will he be fulfilled? no
		- fletcher prays on neuman feeling inadequate, constantly moving the goal posts making it impossible for fletcher to be truly actually pleased
		- fletcher has no regard for the actual people hes bullying, just respect for the craft
			- is it wrong to idolize people like fletcher?
			- TK
	- can truly great work be done while fueled by desire to prove oneself?
		- yes but its not sustainable
		- 
		- TK
	- i’ve had the unfortunate pleasure of having a fletcher-like personality in my own life
		- how has this shaped me as a person?
		- 
- can obsession ever be healthy?
	- seasonality re: robin sloan

## simon sarris efforts and goals and joy
- I find it ideal to always have more ambitions, plans, and projects than one could possibly accomplish. Aspirations — even unlikely ones, maybe _especially_ unlikely ones — are an essential part of living well. When we are at our most ailing, we are reduced to thinking and talking only of our ailments. When we are at our most vigorous, our most alive, we think and talk of our goals and aspirations. Over long time frames, the pessimist becomes an unobservant man, and the optimist creates the world.
- Dreaming alone is seductive, even a little sweet, since it lacks the pain of trying.
- You should have ideals, but you cannot only love an idealized future, you must cultivate a love of effort, too. If you _really_ want something, then the soul must make demands of the body.
- What can I attempt that will be worthwhile, serious enough that it might end in failure?
