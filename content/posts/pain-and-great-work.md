- whiplash asks the question “what is worthwhile”
	- pursuing what you are naturally good at vs forcing yourself to do something you think is good
		- probably tied to scientific freedom/taste argument

	- "You're incredibly gifted, Sam. But it is worth noting that to be good at something is not quite the same as loving it."

- how much great work has gone undeveloped because we didnt push someone hard enough?
	- fletcher in the movie implies that we lose a lot because of this
	- but what actually happens to neuman? he’ll likely fucking lose it in 30 years and turn into fletcher or kill himself like sean casey
		- will he be good at what he does? probably
		- will he be fulfilled? no
		- fletcher prays on neuman feeling inadequate, constantly moving the goal posts making it impossible for fletcher to be truly actually pleased
		- fletcher has no regard for the actual people hes bullying, just respect for the craft
			- is it wrong to idolize people like fletcher?
			- TK
	- can truly great work be done while fueled by desire to prove oneself?
		- yes but its not sustainable

	- i’ve had the unfortunate pleasure of having a fletcher-like personality in my own life
		- how has this shaped me as a person?
		- TK
- can obsession ever be healthy?
