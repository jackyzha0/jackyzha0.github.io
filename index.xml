Physical facts then, are objective truth (&amp;ldquo;the kind that can be observed and understood from many points of view and by individuals with different perceptual systems&amp;rdquo;) Even if we knew everything about how the bat&amp;rsquo;s sonar system works, we would not know what is is like for the bat to perceive using this system.</description>
