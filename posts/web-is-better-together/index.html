</blockquote>
<p><img src="/thoughts/images/minecraft.png" width="auto" /></p>
<p>I vividly remember the Minecraft LAN parties we would have on lunch breaks during middle school. Our eyes, glued to the wall clock as each minute by agonizing minute ticked by slowly. The lunch bell would ring and we rush out into the hallway to set up our laptops. We spent the next 55 minutes tapping at our keys, yelling about how somebody stole all the diamonds we spent the last week collecting and how there was a village just over the hill. After school we retreated to the computer lab to play more Minecraft before our parents drove to pick us up to go home.</p>
<p>At some point, IT at school blocked the port ranges that Minecraft uses to establish local multiplayer worlds. No more lunch-time Minecraft. I remember asking the school if we could run a Minecraft server using the school computers and they said no.</p>
<p>As any stubborn middle schooler would do, I spent the next few weeks figuring out how to host my own Minecraft server on a laptop at home because who was the school administration to tell me what I could do on my lunch break. Running this server meant that us gathering in our virtual blocky world didn&rsquo;t need to stop as soon as we left the school perimeter.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I would get up at 2am and sneak downstairs to my laptop to figure out which cool new plugins and mods we could add and combine without completely crashing the game. I sneaked because I was only allowed 45 minutes of computer time after school.</p>
<p>I cried because in the last week before winter break, some random person joined and completely blew up the server with TNT and we didn&rsquo;t know backups were a thing.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 7th grade, our home room teacher showed us 
<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="noopener">Scratch</a> for the first time. The majority of fun with Scratch was sharing. Posting graphics on the walls, modifying and experimenting with each other&rsquo;s work, and bringing the &ldquo;new&rdquo; products back to the original inventors.</p>
<p>But the real spark of Scratch came from just how easy it was to make shared state. In Scratch, you can create a 
<a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Cloud_Data" rel="noopener">globally consistent variable</a> that is synced across every one who ran my game just as easily as a piece of local state. Adding a leaderboard to my game was just as easy to replacing my variable with a Cloud Variable. Magic.</p>
<p>With years of hindsight, I realize how much I took these experiences for granted. I took for granted how easy it was to make collaborative and multiplayer software.</p>
<hr>
<p>These were my early days of being together in digital space.</p>
<p>When I look at the web today, it feels like an abandoned mall. All I see are the echoes and ephemeral traces of strangers and friends, occasionally bumping into someone as they type a message in response to a post.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the way the web is designed, it makes it pretty difficult to do all the collaborative software I dreamed would be possible when I was a kid. I&rsquo;m left wondering how we can make these sorts of experiences not just exclusive to video games and children&rsquo;s programming languages but to the software we use everyday.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. Despite how much of our time is spent on platforms that are designed to &lsquo;connect us&rsquo; or make us feel closer with our friends, it feels overwhelmingly <em>flat</em>. We scroll through miles of content &ndash; content that we know millions of others have laid their eyes on &ndash; yet we still feel more lonely than ever.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s because we, as citizens of the internet, have felt like we&rsquo;ve lost our ability to shape it and make it a home. We&rsquo;ve lost the ability to have a say in what it looks like to the eye, and how it feels to the soul.</p>
<p>In the collective murmuring of the <a href="/thoughts/cozy-software" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/cozy-software">cozy web</a>, there has been a slow shift in the zeitgeist &ndash; we want the cozy internet back. We want it to feel like ours, not one owned by gigantic megacorporations. It is a call for software that feels playful and agentic; one that expands what we feel like we can do with our digital selves and connect with others in ways that we couldn&rsquo;t without it.</p>
<p>Truthfully, this is still why I think having personal websites and digital places of exploration and play so important. It&rsquo;s like having your own little plot on the internet to change and modify at your own whim. This is our last little bit of land in an era where we leave our <a href="/thoughts/Moving-Castles#the-story-of-all-powerful-wizards" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Moving-Castles">wizardly powers</a> to build worlds of our choosing at the door of digital giants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They hint at possibilities for technologies that we could use in our everyday life, not to accomplish well-defined tasks, but to expand in undefined directions. Open-ended and personal, they encourage us to play – seriously – with experiences, ideas and other people</p>

<hr>
<p>Spencer, I&rsquo;ve absolutely loved reading your musing and lab notes over the past summer. In your most recent 
<a href="https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-01-our-internet" rel="noopener">Lab Dispatch</a>, you talked a lot about a pluralistic internet. This is a vision you and I have both 
<a href="https://pluriverse.world/" rel="noopener">thought and talked a lot about</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/thoughts/images/spencer-lab-notes.png" width="auto" /></p>
<p>There is no single right answer for what a future internet might look like, but I do know that it contains multitudes. Our current digital &lsquo;commons&rsquo; have grown too large to handle.</p>
<p>A proper commons require nuanced labor of governance and maintenance—finding the balance between welcoming everyone and providing safety and comfort for everyone—is critical to the health of communities. Clearly, this is not something that any single company or government can reasonably provide to the tune of billions of users.</p>
<p>Everyone has different needs from their digital spaces. Yet, we really only see a handful of these major &lsquo;social hubs&rsquo; or &lsquo;commons&rsquo; on the internet today.</p>
<p>They are dangerous not because they are necessarily large or serve many users, but because they offer no other way to use it than the <a href="/posts/towards-data-neutrality" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/posts/towards-data-neutrality">wholesale package deals they offer.</a> Unlike with our typical physical belongings, these lumbering software giants provide no way for users to make it their own, to tweak it in ways that work best for them.</p>
<p>Two immediate thoughts on how we can approach this:</p>
<ol>
<li>We make multiple smaller networks that all work with each other. A plurality of networks means that people can choose what works best for them. However, it is not sufficient to just have <em>many options</em>, but that these options need to have <a href="/thoughts/credible-exit" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/credible-exit">credible exit</a> and interoperability. Using one network should not prevent you from collaborating or interacting with someone on another network. Leaving a network should not mean that you lose the ability to use all of the data you made on that network. Or,</li>
<li>We need to design for and explicitly allow for user-made <a href="/thoughts/desire-paths" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/desire-paths">desire paths</a> and <a href="/thoughts/cozy-software#folk-software" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/cozy-software">folk-usages of software</a>. People will use software in whatever informal, distributed ways that emerge from real world contexts. Folksonomies are a great example of these informal taxonomies developed by users on social sharing platforms. Tumblr tags, for example, have adapted to become not just a form of tagging or organizing, but also metacommentary, memes, and other comedic content.</li>
</ol>
<p>This later point is one that Chia talks a lot about in her articulation 
<a href="https://chias.blog/2022/there-is-an-internet-that-is-mine/" rel="noopener">for a future of the internet</a>. While the web is deeply beautiful, it is also deeply broken. But broken does not mean unmendable.</p>
<p>In fact, to declare it unmendable or unfixable is to abandon the many people that still need these deeply broken technologies &ldquo;to flourish when the city and real-world offered us no other space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, Chia is asking that, instead of blaming these people for continuing to use these technologies, that we should pay to how they <em>continue</em> to use the technology <em>despite</em> the harsh environments.</p>
<p>To try to reform the web is not to wipe everything and start over <em>tabula rasa</em>, but rather to move through the 
<a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/evolution-adjacent-possible" rel="noopener">adjacent possible</a>, figuring out how we can improve the existing condition of those trapped by these systems without uprooting them.</p>
<p>It is not enough for some engineers to fully design a protocol to try to solve all of this, but rather to make it possible for the average layperson to be able to change and adapt software for their own needs. To make software not like a professional chef, but <a href="/thoughts/cozy-software" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/cozy-software">a home cook</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like any society, it is not only architects, builders, or engineers that move us towards this collective consciousness. We need people to bring themselves and assume new identities—perhaps where the role of ‘technologist’ is fluid and all-encompassing. Where ‘technologist’ is everyone and anyone concerned with the role of technology, empowered to use it to shape their experience in our pervasive digital world.</p>
<p>(Chia, <em>
<a href="https://chias.blog/2022/there-is-an-internet-that-is-mine" rel="noopener">There is an internet that is mine &amp; I would like you to live in it with me</a></em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>How might we enable more people to become the software equivalent of a home cook? To make software not just the tools of the elite but the layfolks as well. Just as pens were taken out of the hands of the scribe during the Reformation of Europe, we must take the code out of the hands of software engineers and give it to the masses.</p>
<p>We need to reduce the burden of building software. Not all tools need to be complex power tools that require degrees to operate. Progress can mean simplifying tools to enable the layman to shape his immediate environment to his taste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope this mode can paint the picture of software, not as a teleological instrument careening towards automation and ease, but as a medium for intimacy with the matter of our time (images, audio, video), yielding a sense of agency with what, to most, feels like an indelible substrate.
 
(Cristóbal Sciutto, <em>
<a href="https://cristobal.space/writing/folk" rel="noopener">Folk (Browser) Interfaces</a></em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first step to this seems to be to dispel the myth that the internet and the web as a whole is something so vast and monolithic that it is unchangeable. I know we talked about this briefly on a walk this past summer, but it has been living rent-free in my head ever since.</p>
<p>Sometimes we look at these entrenched protocols and take them as a given. But here&rsquo;s the wonderful bit about software (and specifically the web) that feels uniquely special: you don&rsquo;t need permission to make things.</p>
<p>The internet is the first place people got to build real things without needing to ask someone if they could. This is powerful. We should give people the ability to own technology, to bring it into their own complex life stories. The <em>real</em> use cases may be the ones waiting to be discovered. One of my favourite examples is of the bistro.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The small Parisian restaurants serving home-cooked meals in very modest settings—like the cafe before it, was an invention. Many tales exist of its origin. Some say it was working-class landlords opening their kitchens for extra income. Others say it was the Auvergnats, immigrating to Paris from what is today central-south France, who first worked as rag-pickers, then wood and coal sellers, then metalworkers, who created small working-class restaurants to supplement their income. <strong>Either way, it was not planned or engineered, but simply not-disallowed.</strong> There were no rules in place to stop this invention.</p>
<p>(Simon Sarris, <em>
<a href="https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/welcome-ghosts" rel="noopener">Welcome, ghosts</a></em>, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best pieces of software I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of using are ones that are agentic. Examples like Minecraft and Scratch let me fully construct a world for myself in which I operate. They set the rules, but <em>I</em> am the once who decides how I want to play.</p>
<p>Software shouldn&rsquo;t just offer surface level customization like themes or fonts, but rather true atomic building blocks that form the ingredients from which you can construct your universe.</p>
<hr>
<p>Robin Sloan talks about this briefly in a recent 
<a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/new-avenues/" rel="noopener">labnote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to insist on an amateur internet; a garage internet; a public library internet; a kitchen table internet. At last, in 2023, I want to tell the tech CEOs and venture capitalists: pipe down. Buzz off. Go fave each other’s tweets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the Silicon Valley question of what the billion-dollar version of your idea is and how can you get <em>everyone</em> using it is slowly poisoning how we think about software. Scale is good but only if users still have agency over how they want to use it. It only good if this scale is not a totalizing monopoly that suffocates alternatives by not providing <a href="/thoughts/credible-exit" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/credible-exit">credible exit</a>. Unfortunately, this is <a href="/posts/towards-data-neutrality" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/posts/towards-data-neutrality">no longer the case on the web today</a>.</p>
<p>So what might a more amateaur, cozy, internet look like? What does a collection of smaller (perhaps a tiny) internets look like?</p>
<p>My first instinct is to take the LANs we are so fond of and apply them to the larger web. The web used to be pretty flexible. In the days when 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion" rel="noopener">we still had IPv4 addresses</a>, when  
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" rel="noopener">CORS</a> and <a href="/thoughts/NAT" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/NAT">NAT</a> hadn&rsquo;t make the web <a href="/thoughts/peer-to-peer" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> hostile, LANs meant it was to just learn about computers and experiment with things in a LAN. I didn&rsquo;t need to get a credit card so I could buy a machine somewhere on the Cloud (tm) to run my silly little Minecraft sever, I could just run something on my machine and open the port to my computer from my router and anyone in the world could see it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is no secret that our modern internet is peer-to-peer hostile. Almost all of the communication we do on the web is fully client-server because that was the easiest way to make things secure and work.</p>
<p>It has become so difficult that running your own server is no longer the default, but rather hallmark of the &rsquo;low-tech movement&rsquo;. Indie game developers rarely make globally multiplayer games because running the servers to make it happen is way too expensive and complex to justify. Moxie Marlinspike 
<a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html" rel="noopener">once said</a> that &ldquo;Nobody wants to run their own servers.&rdquo; I think this is true given the current state of how hostile the web is to any sort of homebrew hosting</p>
<p>Which, to be completely fair, is a valid approach to take. Security is a hard problem to solve and there are a lot of malicious people out on the web. But going down this path closes a lot of doors for what we <em>could</em> be doing with the internet.</p>
<p>Part of this comes down to the entrenched nature of how the web is structured. Our browsers and home computers can only speak and request from services, but we&rsquo;ve lost the ability to 
<a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/bad-hosts/" rel="noopener">listen for others and serve services of our own</a>.</p>
<p>Centralized providers aren&rsquo;t necessarily better or worse than decentralized approaches, but its the path we take because it is easy and well-worn. Instead of saying that this is the <em>only</em> way to make a secure web, let us think about how we make a multiplayer, peer-to-peer web just as secure and easy to build on top of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am starting to think 50% of the ease and power of centralization is just a stable, public IPv4 address.</p>
<p>(Robin Sloan, <em>
<a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/bad-hosts/" rel="noopener">Bad Hosts</a></em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have an inkling that this needs to be addressed at a deeper pedagogical level as well. It is way too damn difficult to make collaborative and distributed software. I spent a lot of time around university-aged students who are considering career paths in software and almost all of them want to go into some form of front-end or full-stack development. To them, the <em>web</em> and all of its protocols is an entity so out of reach for them that they dare not try. Projects like Scratch and 
<a href="https://twitter.com/cocobuild/status/1600889874688528394" rel="noopener">CoCo</a> do an excellent job of introducing younger children to the possibilities of collaborative software. How do we bring this to developing web apps? Mobile apps? Protocols?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning how to store passwords or add OAuth2 to your toy web site is not fun. So much of programming today is busywork, or playing defense against a raging internet. You can do so much more, but the activation energy required to start writing fun collaborative software is so much higher you end up using some half-baked SaaS instead.

Writing a web service for use by your friends should not be a form of combat, where you spend your days worrying about XSS attacks or buffer overflows. You should be focused on creating something new and wonderful in a place without bad people hounding you.</p>

<em>From the blogpost introducing

<p>I think I would summarize the current state of the web as a one where we&rsquo;ve collectively forgotten what it is like to be a good host. We leave that to the professionals; why should <em>we</em> bother?</p>
<p>But those magically small trusted networks and care-free programs don&rsquo;t need to be just history we look back on. I dream of a future where we have this LAN-like experience back again with all the best parts of the 21st century internet. <strong>A safe small space of people we trust, where we can coexist away from the prying eyes of the multi-billion-person internet.</strong></p>
<p>What does this look like? I&rsquo;ve thought about this a bit while I was writing my <a href="/thoughts/Rhizome-Proposal" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Rhizome-Proposal">Rhizome Proposal</a> and I&rsquo;ll elaborate more on the philosophy of it here.</p>
<p>The internet is a network of networks. This is a true at the level of hardware and infrastructure, but less so for the applications we depend so heavily on. What if we also made the web a network of networks? And users could be a part of multiple networks at once? This isn&rsquo;t something too far fetched either, we&rsquo;re just making an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network" rel="noopener">overlay network</a>!</p>
<p>We could have:</p>
<ol>
<li>Countless local networks, many overlapping with each other. This like routing at the <a href="/thoughts/Network-Layer#internal-gateway-protocols-igp" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Network-Layer">IGP Level</a>
<ul>
<li>This is different in that LAN here does not necessarily mean closely geolocated, but rather <strong>close in social and trust space</strong>.</li>
<li>Everything that happens in these &lsquo;friend&rsquo; networks is trusted by default. We allow users to have agency over their local networks and give them the space and freedom to screw up, experiment, learn, and coexist with their friends.</li>
<li>Everything under the local network is considered &lsquo;same origin&rsquo; for CORS related purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A larger network of networks. This allows cross-network collaboration to happen. This is like routing at the <a href="/thoughts/Network-Layer#external-gateway-protocol-egp" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Network-Layer">EGP Level</a>
<ul>
<li>Strict security rules by default, but easy for mutual servers to trust each other by setting special rules</li>
<li>This is the digital equivalent of MIT’s famous ‘Infinite Corridor’ — an 825-foot-long hallway that runs the entire length of MIT’s main buildings? On the walls of this corridor are posters and calls to attend workshops and events. It is a public hub that connects more relatively private spaces like classrooms, labs, and other creative spaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These local networks will allow much more home-cooked and casual software to emerge. More people willing to run websites, servers, and fun-apps from old laptops and phones. But there is another layer on top of just networking I am gesturing at too.</p>
<p>We need new ways of relating to each other online, outside the false spectrum of super offline, asynchronous collaboration and super online video calls and live cursors. There is a <a href="/thoughts/collaborative-software#a-spectrum" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/collaborative-software">spectrum of collaboration</a>. What is the space between these two extremes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just like how a knob affords finer control over one’s preferences, similarly, a CoCo space is designed to provide creators with the agency to choose when and in what way they’d like to engage with their peers, based on their own comfort and preferences at any moment.</p>

<p>How can we create shared <em>artifacts</em> that are permanent and can be grown over time? A digital indication that a space is lived in and occupied?</p>

<p>As of now, most platforms keep a primative chat log or history but thats it. What if there was a way to create digital 
<a href="https://twitter.com/samihusseni/status/1329499588982575104" rel="noopener">gardens</a> to foster and maintain existing relationships? A commonspace you could both take care of, share, and contribute to. Completely private common spaces often allow users to put whatever and allow people can construct their own digital nooks and cozy spaces.</p>
<p>In any shared creative space, people are always engaged in two kinds of construction. One of their immediate project like a game, story, or art piece but the other is the construction of the social environment or their <strong>shared context</strong> with peers.</p>
<p>What would it be like to not just chat and be around others, but to 
<a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/thinking-together" rel="noopener">sense-make</a> and world together? Maybe this involves having a shared calendar, todo list, books. Or even just a space to co-live and co-exist in 





<a

  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/thoughts/virtual-worlds/">virtual worlds</a>. Most online RPG games like Animal Crossing, Minecraft, Stardew Valley give the option for users to have a shared space to exist and build together (and where both people don&rsquo;t necessarily both need to be present for the space to function).</p>
<p>None of these arguments or points are necessarily new or unique. I&rsquo;m repeating what lots of people before me have thought about deeply (and have hopefully given credit and links where they make sense).</p>
<p>Yet I write this piece because I believe that <em>visions matter</em>. Visions give people a direction and inspire people to act, and <em>a group of inspired people is the most powerful force in the world</em>.</p>
<p>We create fiction because they are statements about the future instead of a statement of today. They rally people around shared language and goals and allow us to collaborate beyond just <a class="internal-link broken">Dunbar-scale networks</a>. And for a revolution of this scale, we need fiction.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t just literary fiction. We need protocol fiction. We need business model fictions, engineering feasibility study fictions, interop protocol specification fictions, investment return fictions. We need 
<a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2022/08/11/casi" rel="noopener">speculative infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p>Spencer, I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re slowly finding the people in the world who are just as excited about these values as we are. I want to extend an open invite to others who have thought about this to lend their thoughts.</p>
<p>Join us as we write about what it would be a like to make these fictions become reality. Let&rsquo;s make the web feel local and multi-player again. Let&rsquo;s LAN the internet again.</p>
