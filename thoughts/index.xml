Characteristics:
Distributed: data is stored by and updates are broadcasted to everyone Smart Contracts: codified agreements. Once the predetermined conditions of the contract are met, the transaction and attached computation are completed and recorded on the blockchain. Immutable: A completed transaction can never be changed or hidden. This gives us provenance of assets (you can determine any asset&amp;rsquo;s entire history as long as all transactions happen on-chain) Decentralized : communal consensus rather than one party&amp;rsquo;s decisions determines access/update to the chain On a technical level, blockchain is just a distributed linked list.</description></item><item><title>Money</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/money/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/money/</guid><description>Source ??todo link back to this
Money is old. &amp;ldquo;We have yet to discover a civilization that didn&amp;rsquo;t have money. So, we know it&amp;rsquo;s at least as old as civilization.&amp;rdquo;
Money is a language through which to communicate value. Then, was does this mean for decentralization ? No one should control the expression of economic value in exactly the same way that no one controls the meaning of words: they are arrived at consensually through common use.</description></item><item><title>Trust</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/trust/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/trust/</guid><description>??todo link back to this
Source Trust is only meaningful once we have fully understood how people can lie.
Having clearly defined and encoded rules means that there is an implicit shift from trusting those who own the medium to those who are transacting. In essense, trusting peers rather than a regulatory power.
This feels like its missing an important step in the process: trusting the medium. If people don&amp;rsquo;t understand how the medium works to facilitate transactions, how can they trust it?</description></item><item><title>Black boxes</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/black-box/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/black-box/</guid><description>Scientific and technical work is made invisible by its own success.

The argument is that all professions are mixtures of theory and practice. If a job is so simple that it is just a series of steps to carry out (algorithmic), then it is not a profession (counterpoint: can everything be reduced into algorithmic steps? How concrete do the steps need to be?).

Intelligence can only be contextually based on information available. There are no intrinsically difficult questions, only wrt inputs
Dretske Can intelligence be artificial? two ways of thinking about it like money → everyone has, some have more than others philosophers view like wealth → something possessed by only those who have more than the average amount of money computer scientists view thought alone is not enough, the thoughts need to do something, and sometimes explain the doing actions that are not governed by/explained by thought are not intelligent in order to be intelligent, the behaviour must be under the control of the content of the thought and not the vehicle of the content plant analogy even if you know what physical events inside the plant are causing the change in colour, don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily know why the plant is changing colour could be a result to encouraging different polinators or discouraging beetles from eating it what about laboratory grown?</description></item><item><title>Extended Mind</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/extended-mind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 13:18:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/extended-mind/</guid><description>Sterelny Minds: extended or scaffolded?
Extended view of the mind not an internal control system, enclosed in the human body, receiving data from human sensory system and directing human action instead, as systems that extend far beyond the body of the human organism, systems that include extra-somatic resources: environmental fuels for adaptive action suggest that human cognitive systems include those resources that are importantly, robustly, reliably, or persistently supportive of decisions making Theory of Niche Construction many animals intervene in their environment, shaping it in ways that improve the adaptive fit between the agent and its world such animals in part adapt to their niche, in part construct their own the niche construction perspective focuses our attention on the common features of this whole range of cases whereas the extended mind model does not human capacities, cognitive and non-cognitive alike, turn out to depend on the fact that humans engineer their environment to support their activities extended digestion example some animals do the hard digestion stuff on-board, powerful jaws, large mouths, lots of time chewing we cook lmao also, we selectively breed livestock which improves the food value of domestic stock Extended Phenotypes Concept things animals build are part of their phenotype (physical exhibited traits that are determined genetically) developmentally stable, as heritable and predictable in their ecological effects as other traits e.</description></item><item><title>On Idolization</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/articles/on-idolization/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 23:36:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/articles/on-idolization/</guid><description>https://blog.matthewwang.me/life/concise21/2021/03/01/on-idolization.html

Mathematics is a striking example of this. For centuries, countless minds have climbed the mountain range of mathematics and laid new boulders at the top.
