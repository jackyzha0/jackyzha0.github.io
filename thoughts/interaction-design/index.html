<p>Go ahead and pick up a book. Open it up to some page. Notice how you <em>know</em> where you are in the book by the distribution of weight in each hand, and the thickness of the page stacks between your fingers.

<p>Take a moment to pick up the objects around you. Use them as you normally would, and sense their tactile response — their texture, pliability, temperature; their distribution of weight; their edges, curves, and ridges; how they <em>respond</em> in your hand as you use them.</p>

<p>New representations of thought — written <a href="/thoughts/language" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/language">language</a>, numerals, mathematical notation, data graphics — have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity’s collectively-thinkable territory.

<p>On making things that are just toys:</p>
<ul>
<li>I kind of want to make more things that are just toys where it&rsquo;s fun to interact with the thing, because I feel like that actually sets a very high bar, a game can be fun because it has a story or it has cool characters or there&rsquo;s a scoring system or something. But a toy, it has to be fun to

</ul>
<p>On physical analogues of software:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think that they&rsquo;re all about trying to take stuff in the computer and give them some of the richness and texture and embodiment of things in the real world and scale also. Where everything on the computer is kind of pristine and closed and perfect and you can&rsquo;t touch it and it doesn&rsquo;t decay, and it all kind of fits in this 11 inch rectangle.</li>

<p>Can we create the visuals of a well-polished science YouTube live like a blackboard?</p>
<p>Can we map concept space to physical space and use the stage as an outline of the presentation? Kind of like a book where you can tell how much of it you&rsquo;re finished by the weight of each side, can the audience see what the presenter has already covered?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Playfair’s invention of data graphics was transformative because it tapped into capabilities of the human visual system which had gone unused in intellectual work. It may be similarly transformative to tap into the profound capabilities that enable a person to tie a shoelace or make a sandwich, and bring them to bear on more abstract thinking.</p>

<p>In the seventies, Alan Kay introduced the concept of Personal Dynamic Media that let a user “mold and channel its power to his own needs”</p>
<p>Two decades later, Mark Weiser envisioned a future of ubiquitous computing, where heterogenous devices of varying sizes and capabilities interact easily with each other and technology disappears into the background.</p>
<p>Substrates are software artifacts that embody content, computation and interaction, effectively blurring the distinction between documents and applications.</p>
