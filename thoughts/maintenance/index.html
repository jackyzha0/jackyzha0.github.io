<p>&ldquo;What happens <em>after</em> innovation, they argue, is more important.

<p><strong>It is crucial to understand that technology is not innovation.</strong> This preoccupation with novelty is unfortunate because it fails to account for technologies in widespread use, and it obscures how many of the things around us are quite old.</p>
<p>The stalest innovation stories focus on well-to-do white guys sitting in garages in a small region of California, but human beings in the Global South live with technologies too. Which ones? Where do they come from? How are they produced, used, repaired?</p>

<a href="#maintenance-and-care"><h2 id="maintenance-and-care"><span class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"># </span>Maintenance and Care</h2></a>
<p>

<a href="https://placesjournal.org/article/maintenance-and-care" rel="noopener">Shannon Mattern in Places Journal</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All of the incentives for all the actors are against maintenance. Nobody ever named a maintenance project, nobody ever got recognized for a maintenance project, nobody ever much got blamed for deferring maintenance during the time while they were in office.”</p>
</blockquote>
<a href="#rust-urban-infrastructures"><h3 id="rust-urban-infrastructures"><span class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"># </span>Rust: urban infrastructures</h3></a>
<p>Outsiders sometimes make the mistake of focusing on the rusty bridges and broken pipes — the “defective objects” themselves — whereas local fixers are more concerned with “the social and political relationships in which [those objects are] embedded.”</p>
<p>As Nikhil Anand writes in <em>Hydraulic City</em>, &ldquo;The maintenance of water infrastructures binds residents, plumbers, engineers, and politicians in an (uneven) system of “hydraulic citizenship.”&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should always ask: what, exactly, is being maintained? “Is it the thing itself,” Graham and Thrift ask, “or the negotiated order that surrounds it, or some ‘larger’ entity?” Often the answer is all of the above.</p>
<p>We should also remember that the preservation of our world — the human one — is sometimes at odds with caring for the ecological context. Perhaps not every road <em>should</em> be repaired. Geographer Caitlin DeSilvey encourages us to embrace entropy within the built world, to ask ourselves <em>for whom</em> we engage in preservation, and to consider cultivating an acceptance of “curated decay” where appropriate.</p>
<a href="#dust-domestic-maintenance-housework-care-work"><h3 id="dust-domestic-maintenance-housework-care-work"><span class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"># </span>Dust: domestic maintenance, housework, care work</h3></a>
<p>Maintaining life — that’s a big job. Joan Tronto and Berenice Fisher define care as “everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair ‘our world’ so that we can live in it as well as possible.</p>
<p><strong>We care for things not because they produce value, but because they already have value.</strong></p>
<p>Aryn Martin, Natasha Myers, and Ana Viseu propose that a critical practice of care would “pay attention to the privileged position of the caring subject, wary of who has the power to care, and who or what tends to get designated the proper or improper objects of care.”</p>
<a href="#cracks-repair-of-objects"><h3 id="cracks-repair-of-objects"><span class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"># </span>Cracks: repair of objects</h3></a>
<p>“repair not only extends the use value of objects but becomes a mechanism of social interaction.” People gather around, watch, and chat. The shop is a space of public pedagogy, an “operating theater” where the repairman opens gadgets, demonstrates technical skills, and perhaps encourages observers to mend rather than discard their own broken things</p>
<a href="#corruption-curators-who-clean-and-maintain-data"><h3 id="corruption-curators-who-clean-and-maintain-data"><span class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"># </span>Corruption: curators who clean and maintain data</h3></a>
<p>Historian Nathan Ensmenger reports that “from the early 1960s to the present, software maintenance costs have represented between 50 and 70 percent of all total expenditures on software development.”</p>
<p>The internal maintenance work isn’t supposed to be visible to end users, who tend to like the idea that they’re working with “raw” data. Yet “data never come as raw,” Plantin observes. “Multiple interventions are always needed before data can be reused.”</p>
