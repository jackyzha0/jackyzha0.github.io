<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06777.pdf" rel="noopener">Live, Rich, and Composable: Qualities for Programming Beyond Static Text</a>
<ul>
<li>We hypothesize that by combining liveness, richness, and composability, programming systems can meaningfully extend the capabilities of static text without losing its characteristic expressivity.</li>
<li>Liveness: providing programmers with in-depth feedback about a program’s dynamic behaviour as the program is edited.
<ul>
<li>Normally accomplished through some sort of live/hot reload that preserves the state of the system, however this only reflects the final output of the program without revealing any information on the <em>internal model</em> of the program that led to that output</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Richness: allowing programmers to work with domain-specific visualizations and interactions
<ul>
<li>[W]riting code means articulating thoughts as precisely as possible… Often these thoughts involve geometrical relationships: tables, nests of objects, graphs, etc. Furthermore, the geometry differs from problem domain to problem domain. To this day, though, programmers articulate their thoughts as linear text.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/thoughts/composable" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/composable">Composability</a>: the ability to freely combine smaller programmed artifacts into larger ones, to accomplish larger goals
<ul>
<li>Unlike liveness and richness, this is not a quality static text lacks, which interactive programming systems strive to add to it. Rather, it is a familiar quality of static text which new programming systems must work hard to maintain.</li>

<ul>
<li>Defines multisynchronous access which is composed of two modes of accessing data on edge devices:
<ol>
<li>asynchronous mode—the user can always access (read and write) the data on the device, even when the device is off-line, and</li>
<li>synchronous mode—the data on the device is kept synchronous with the data stored in the cloud, as long as the device is online</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Synchronizes tuples using causal-length set CRDT (CLSet CRDT)</li>
<li>Creates a two-layer relational database system where the top layer is the Application Relation (AR) Layer and the bottom is the Conflict-free Replication Relation (CRR) Layer.
<ul>
<li>Any violation of integrity constraint is caught at the AR layer. A local update of $\tilde r_i$ and refresh of $r_i$ are wrapped in an atomic transaction: a violation would cause the rollback of the transaction. A merge at $\tilde r_i$ and a refresh at $r_i$ is also wrapped in a transaction: a failed merge would cause some compensation updates.</li>

<ul>
<li>John McCarthy, inventor of LISP on logical time
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;John started thinking about modal logics, but then realized that simply keeping histories of changes and indexing them with a “pseudo-time” when a “fact” was asserted to hold, could allow functional and logical reasoning and processing. He termed “situations” all the “facts” that held at a particular time — a kind of a “layer” that cuts through the world lines of the histories.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NAMOS by David Patrick Reed: versions have two component names consisting of the name of an object and a pseudo-time, the name of the system state to which the version belongs
<ul>
<li>Synchronization is then treated as a mechanism for naming version to be read and for defining where in the sequence of versions the version resulting from some update should be placed</li>

<li>An economically sustainable model for local-first software from the 
<a href="https://lo-fi.gfor.rest/docs/manifesto" rel="noopener">lo-fi manifesto</a>
<ol>
<li>Users can use the product for free on their own device, and free users don&rsquo;t cost anything (or next to nothing) to &ldquo;host.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Only paying subscribers utilize paid server infrastructure. Meaning, every server request and megabyte of database storage has associated revenue.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I <em>like</em> having technical principles like &ldquo;local-first,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m even more excited by what these concepts can enable in terms of building more authentic, sustainable, and personable software products online.</li>
<li>The hard problem of schema migration:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;In a traditional cloud-hosted model, you&rsquo;d do some diagramming, tweak your database schema to support the new system, and then schedule some time to deploy a migration. Users wake up the next day, update the app, and find their data has already been massaged into a new shape, ready for 2.0&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t get that in local-first world. There&rsquo;s no magic spell you can utter overnight to change your app&rsquo;s data across everyone&rsquo;s devices. You can update your own server, but the clients who connect will still be running 1.0 when they do.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>The physical frontiers of our world are largely mapped and tamed. But the digital frontier is endless, and it&rsquo;s always open to settlers seeking better ways forward. We are all free to venture forth, follow our curiosity and aliveness, direct our attention in new ways, and find the others. We are free to trust our intuition when it says &ldquo;<em>things can be so much better than this.</em>&rdquo;</li>
<li>Local spaces of abundance: &ldquo;Oases give us the breathing room to experience the fullness and richness of our humanity. In an oasis, we have the safety, space, and resources to begin blossoming into more fully realized versions of ourselves.&rdquo;</li>

<li>I feel like there is a large common ground between <code>git</code>, <a href="/thoughts/CRDT" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/CRDT">CRDTs</a> and room for cross-pollination across both
<ul>
<li>Both basically focus on version control and collaboration</li>
<li>However, both aren&rsquo;t perfect
<ul>
<li>The railroad metaphor for <code>git</code> is powerful but the affordances of how to manipulate it aren&rsquo;t made clear to the end-user. CRDTs don&rsquo;t explicitly expose version control to the end-user</li>
<li>CRDTs have great conflict-free merge semantics that <code>git</code> (relatively) sucks at</li>

<li>Products derive value from benefiting end-users directly</li>
<li>Protocols derive value by expanding the horizons for what can be build

<li>That is, the value is not reified into people build on top of it</li>

<li>Why continually <em>doing</em> matters
<ul>
<li>People talk about &lsquo;momentum&rsquo; when it comes to projects a lot</li>
<li>I get told by people looking to do more projects/research that they <em>think</em> about it a lot but rarely spend much time actually <em>doing it</em></li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/sunshine-skyway/" rel="noopener">Robin Sloan captures this well</a>:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;When you start a creative project but don’t finish, the experience drags you down. Worst of all is when you never decisively abandon a project, instead allowing it to fade into forgetfulness. The fades add up; they become a gloomy haze that whispers, <em>you’re not the kind of person who DOES things.</em>&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;When you start and finish, by contrast — and it can be a project of any scope: a 24-hour comic, a one-page short story, truly anything — it is powerful fuel that goes straight back into the tank.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Unfinished work drags and depresses; finished work redoubles and accelerates.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Truly doing something that is creative and agentic <em>gives</em> you energy. It doesn&rsquo;t drain it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A* path search for DHTs? Locality mapping?
<ul>
<li>This 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7dyCDE-lw0" rel="noopener">video explainer of Meridian</a> is really cool too! Taking account earth curvature when working with distance estimations
<ul>
<li>Essentially, the idea is for each node-to-node query hand-off to &ldquo;zoom in&rdquo; to the solution space, reducing the necessary state requirement on each node to only logarithmic of the system size</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optimizing geographical coverage through hypervolumes
<ul>
<li>Say you have a set of K servers in your cluster</li>
<li>And a set of L servers that are candidates</li>
<li>Iteratively sub out servers in K for servers in L to find the set that maximizes the hypervolume to maximize the geographical coverage
<ul>
<li>The ring members are diverse within the enclosed space by looking at the three dimensional case, which selects the three nodes from each ring that form the largest triangle</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This of course assumes laying wires that follow the curvature of the earth. Does this assumption hold for interplanetary systems? Probably not but eh we&rsquo;ll think about it when we get there</li>
</ul>

<li>Record full world state; drop frames and interpolate. However, this isn&rsquo;t exact and can lead to exploits.</li>

<li>Some ideas I found particularly insightful:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What is the <em>handwriting</em> for digital spaces? Something that passively conveys ownership for a particular unit of work&rdquo; (Gus Rasch)
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Someone just surfaced the idea of personal fonts and some other avenues are 1. color, and 2. hand-drawn image&rdquo; (Spencer)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Imbuing digital spaces with personality feels more powerful than you might expect. Makes it easier to remember where things live because they’re “emotionally” different.&rdquo; (Amelia Wattenberger)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Effective diff interfaces: &ldquo;one of the most important factors here is being able to quickly understand the difference between versions.&rdquo; (Amelia Wattenberger)
<ul>
<li>Domain-specific merge flows: &ldquo;How do you enable people to manage many copies and forks of the same document and recombine? Is this going to be the same for prose and digital gardening as it will be for coding? Could we use LLMs to describe differences semantically?&rdquo; (Rob Haisfield)</li>

<ul>
<li>Started thinking about this Git for writing idea which I think will be a good vehicle for thinking about version control systems in general</li>
<li>Prototype Sketch
<ul>
<li>Question: what feels good about a collaborative medium?</li>
<li>Objects that have affordances we can interact with and manipulate in intuitive ways
<ul>
<li>Documents are made up of paragraphs which are made up of characters
<ul>
<li>Block-based editing allows us to manipulate at the paragraph level in addition to the character level editing we get in normal text editors</li>
<li>Networked note taking apps allow us to transclude text which is a very primitive form of document level editing
<ul>
<li>But what about manipulating documents through time?</li>
<li>Time as an object we can interact with and control? Similar to what Bret Victor says in <em>
<a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/" rel="noopener">Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction</a></em>: A designer needs direct, interactive control over the independent variables of the system.</li>
<li>See notes below on version control</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supports a spectrum of collaboration
<ul>
<li>When we&rsquo;re collaborating with others, there&rsquo;s a natural human tendency to desire some privacy while working through something, the freedom to take a piece of the creative work and play out different ideas, move things around, edit and refactor, without fear of judgement or the burden of having to explain or communicate our thinking or concern for overhauling sections where another is actively reading or working. (
<a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/jessmartin/Collaboration&#43;is&#43;a&#43;spectrum&#43;from&#43;asynchronous&#43;to&#43;fully&#43;synchronous" rel="noopener">Jess Martin on Collaboration</a>)
<ul>
<li>Also sometimes called the fish-bowl effect. Some studies have found that real-time collaboration like in Google Docs creates stress as writers feel watched by their co-authors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not just a binary of either <em>working on your own</em> or <em>working with others</em>
<ul>
<li>Normally binded together on a single document (fully sync editing)
<ul>
<li>This is the typical Google Docs or Figma editing experience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obvious button to “make a new version of this document” (async branching)
<ul>
<li>What if we did &lsquo;implicit&rsquo; branching where any change makes a new branch?
<ul>
<li>Open question: Could we utilize <a href="/thoughts/LLMs" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/LLMs">LLMs</a> to bundle these into “commits”?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each copy has an obvious flow of “merge back into original document”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Presence (peripheral awareness of others)
<ul>
<li>Important so people don&rsquo;t step on each others toes when working across versions</li>
<li>Useful information at every scale
<ul>
<li>Coin this the <em><a href="/thoughts/information-scales" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/information-scales">Engelbart Zoom</a></em> which Engelbart explored in 
<a href="https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/154/86/" rel="noopener">HyperScope</a></li>
<li>TKTK: what type of peripheral information is actually useful?
<ul>
<li>e.g. see what paragraphs other people are editing with a scroll bar minimap?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Version control
<ul>
<li>Not only across time (edits to the same document) but also managing parallel versions by different authors</li>
<li>Version <em>control</em> implies agency over how merge and conflict resolution processes occur
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Best-effort&rsquo; merge using traditional merge techniques (borrowing from CRDTs or <code>git</code> merge strategies)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When working with physical objects, holding areas are very normal
<ul>
<li><code>git stash</code> is a really handy tool, but using it through a CLI makes it confusing</li>
<li>Imagine the railroad track metaphor that <code>git</code> uses but each individual commit is an object you can manipulate (iirc GitKraken does this in their GUI but haven&rsquo;t had the chance to play with it yet)
<ul>
<li>Drag the tips of branches together to merge</li>
<li>Select multiple commits and drag them off of a branch
<ul>
<li>This &lsquo;detaches&rsquo; them into free space</li>
<li>You can then &rsquo;re-attach&rsquo; these commits anywhere
<ul>
<li>This is effectively what <code>git stash</code> does</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flexible <a href="/thoughts/access-control" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/access-control">Access Control</a>
<ul>
<li>It feels important to know who has access to your work (and what kind of access?)
<ul>
<li>Users should feel empowered to have agency over whether their work is public- or private-facing</li>
<li>These should also be flexible and dynamic</li>
<li>Open questions: what are good ways to deal with derivative works where the permissions over the source material changes
<ul>
<li>e.g. Say I make a private document public by accident</li>
<li>If someone makes a copy of the public document before I make it private it again, what should happen? Should the user no longer be able to access the document because the source document is no longer public? Should the user still be able to access the document because the fact that it <em>was</em> public at the time it was copied mean they should still have access to it?</li>
<li>Is this something that should even be reinforced at a technical level? Or social level (e.g. bump the responsibility up to users)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modular and customizable workspaces
<ul>
<li>It is important for people to customize the spaces they work in
<ul>
<li>Why force everyone to use the same interface and tools?</li>
<li>We all have differing needs for knowledge and collaborative workspaces</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>End-user scripting like Smalltalk for HyperCard</li>
<li>Subconscious calls this concept &lsquo;geist&rsquo;: programs that may work in concert with users
<ul>
<li>Little agents that crawl over your notes and help suggest things</li>
<li>Each one specialized for its own thing, e.g. a geist that fixes grammar, a geist to suggest common themes between notes that you may have missed</li>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The soundness of state convergence does not translate to predictable guarantees for computations that examine them. One might say that CRDTs provide Schrodinger consistency guarantees: they are guaranteed to be consistent only if they are not viewed&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Can we develop a query model that makes it possible to precisely define when execution on a single replica yields consistent results?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Querying over something monotonic would be nice but computer time is non-monotonic? What about entropy?</li>
<li>&ldquo;The space of monotone queries is quite large; for example, four of the five operators of relational algebra are monotone: selection, projection, union, and intersection. Only set difference is non-monotone.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;A pipeline composing monotone functions will always give a monotone function end-to-end, but if the pipeline contains any non-monotone function then the end-to-end-computation will be non-monotone&rdquo;</li>
<li>^ this is quite similar to earlier observations about RedBlue consistency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;With apologies, potentially-inconsistent observations are accompanied by compensating actions, which are intended to clean up any negative effects of weak consistency. By leveraging lineage tracing, a CRDT-enabled database could automatically determine when such apologies are necessary, prompting the application accordingly&rdquo;

<li>Why immutability actually makes sense when representing real-world things:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Facts don&rsquo;t go away. If the princess&rsquo;s tastes change so that she prefers sriracha, it&rsquo;s still useful to know that in the past she preferred mustard. More importantly, new facts don&rsquo;t obliterate old facts.&rdquo;</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s because time only works in one direction in the universe (that we know of): forward

<li>Merging reallly old changes (

<li>Big usability problem for distributed apps. If a long-dormant device can come online and introduce a single operation that overturns months&rsquo; worth of activity, people will perceive the app as unstable — even if there&rsquo;s no malice and no security issues involved.</li>
<li>Can we set limit <code>L</code> on how far out of date a device can be before we require it to catch up before submitting changes? The idea would be that you couldn&rsquo;t base a change on a head that&rsquo;s older than that. Instead you&rsquo;d have to catch up with the latest information, and then rebase your change onto the current head.

<li><code>L</code> is a wall-clock timestamp</li>

<li>&ldquo;I think one of the questions we have in revisiting the architecture of a database is, what&rsquo;s possible? How much of the value propositions of databases can we retain while tapping into some of the new value propositions of distributed systems, in particular, their arbitrary scalability and elasticity?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Other problems we have in general when we talk about traditional databases are flexibility problems. Everyone knows the rigidity of relational databases and the big rectangles. We also have the artifice of having to form intersection record tables and things like that&rdquo;</li>

<li>Once we have received an acknowledgement from each of our neighbours for a single operation (call this the safety-certificate), it is safe to apply a non-commutative operation on it (we can now delete it or deliver any causal dependents)
<ul>
<li>This works for applications with explicit causal dependencies (e.g. text editing)</li>
<li>However, it is a bit more difficult to reason about for implicit causal dependencies (e.g. access control)</li>
<li>Consider two admins A and B who are accessing the same document.
<ul>
<li>Concurrently:
<ul>
<li><code>op1</code>: Admin A types the letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; in the document</li>
<li><code>op2</code>: Admin B revokes A&rsquo;s access to the document</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The problem is that the algorithm treats these as operations that commute when the clearly don&rsquo;t! Some peers may see &lsquo;a&rsquo; (if they receive <code>op1</code> ahead of <code>op2</code>) and others will not (<code>op2</code> ahead of <code>op1</code> so <code>op1</code> becomes invalidated)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is solved with the epoch-based approach below</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However this requires fixed membership as it seems to completely mishandle cases where members leave the group (can no longer get a whole safety-certificate)
<ul>
<li>This is potentially solved by signalling departure and setting an inactivity timeout for nodes
<ul>
<li>Though using heartbeats to refresh inactivity timeout feels counter to the whole CRDT ethos of offline support</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rollback-based mode
<ul>
<li>Attaching an epoch to each non-commutative operation (this is effectively making the implicit causal dependency explicit)</li>
<li>This implies that each CRDT requires the ability to undo and redo operations between non-commutative operations
<ul>
<li>Not all computation is reversible though (e.g. entropy increasing operations like blurring), how do we reconcile this?</li>
<li>Can we utilize the hashgraph to do git-like rebasing to avoid having to implement a redo?</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>More thoughts on access control</li>
<li><em>
<a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03584553/file/papoc.pdf" rel="noopener">Distributed Access Control for Collaborative Applications using CRDTs</a></em> uses a total ordering of roles in order to resolve access conflicts
<ul>
<li>However, in the case of two top-level administrators revoking access, the same problem occurs</li>
<li>Additionally, it is not not always possible to totally order a set of permissions. Consider one person with access to file 1 but not file 2 and another person with access to file 2 but not file 1.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Combining CRDTs for data with CRDTs for policies raises several challenges. Conflicts between two concurrent operations based on diverging policies cannot be safely resolved.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>They resolve this by attaching an epoch to each policy change
<ul>
<li>The epoch doesn’t grow in size, but merely refers to a parent operation that last changed the policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This implies that each CRDT requires the ability to undo and redo operations between epochs</li>
<li>Undo-redo may be expensive if it happens a lot! The assumption here is that policy changes are rare so this doesn&rsquo;t happen very often</li>

<li>Why GC is hard:
<ul>
<li>First, establishing the stability of an update as described in the paper assumes that the set of all replicas is known and that they do not crash permanently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inspiration from Delta-CRDTs
<ul>
<li>In the causal-consistency-ensuring anti-entropy algorithm. When a node sends a delta-interval to another, the receiving node replies with an acknowledgment after merging the interval into its local state. A delta that has been acknowledged by all of a node’s neighbours is then garbage-collected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Synchronized GC
<ul>
<li>Under two-phase commit, each replica will vote on whether each tombstone is still necessary.</li>

<li>Did a bit more thinking about Kleppmann&rsquo;s <em>Recovering from key compromise in decentralised access control systems</em>
<ul>
<li>I feel like there is a close connection to be made with <a href="/thoughts/Arrows-Impossibility-Theorem" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Arrows-Impossibility-Theorem">Arrow&rsquo;s Impossibility Theorem</a> but haven&rsquo;t been able to formally show it</li>
<li>Perhaps using Quorum Certificates for group membership voting?
<ul>
<li>These can be built offline (and even allows for receiving updates offline) and sent when a user is back online.</li>
<li>A membership change is then considered stable when it receives 2 unique supporting QCs. Of course, this only works with $f&lt;\frac n 3$.</li>
<li>Voting members: all members of the group which were members prior to the membership change</li>
<li>Mutual removal: going with something that is intent-preserving feels important here. One potential way to resolve this is to restrict membership changes to at most one removal per round. Requiring 2 QCs would mean that we have consensus on which group member to remove and removing a single member cannot possibly cause a conflict. (this may not be ideal for situations where a large number of group members are removed but I suspect these cases are very rare)</li>

<ul>
<li>Major challenges:
<ul>
<li>Without some logically centralized repository of data or router of messages, you struggle with discovery and delivery.</li>
<li>Users don&rsquo;t stay consistently online and connections will randomly fail, so you stuggle with availability and performance.</li>
<li>Initial connections and thus time-to-first-paints are slow, which is very bad news for web browsing.</li>
<li>Debugging is quite hard.</li>
<li>Managing resource usage on the device is hard.</li>
<li>Scaling a user&rsquo;s view of the network past (say) 100k users is pretty much out the window because you&rsquo;re not sharing indexes; rather, you&rsquo;re having each device build the indexes locally.

<li>Coordination in CRDTs? Inspiration from the 
<a href="https://pages.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro/papers/RR-6956.pdf" rel="noopener">TreeDoc paper</a>
<ul>
<li>TreeDoc is occasionally flattened from a tree into an array to cleanup tombstones and balancing issues</li>
<li>However, this is <em>not</em> commutative. TreeDoc solves this by using an update-wins approach in a two-phase commit protocol
<ul>
<li>The site that initiates a flatten acts as the coordinator and collects the votes of all other sites. Any site that detects a concurrent update to the flatten votes &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The coordinator aborts the flatten if any site voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; or it never received a response</li>
</ul>

<li>Supporting large groups of replicas

<li>Uses hubs to help scale &ndash; see <a href="/thoughts/Network-Theory" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Network-Theory">Network Theory</a></li>
<li>Core: well-known nodes that are well-connected</li>
<li>Nebula: all other nodes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Epoch-based flattens
<ul>
<li>Each flatten – each change of epoch – changes the frame of reference for TID</li>
<li>A core site maintains a buffer of updates messages it needs to send to the nebula, some in old epoch some in the new one</li>
<li>A nebula site maintains a buffer of update messages to be sent to the core; these are all in the old epoch</li>
<li>The nebula must first bring the out of date messages into the new epoch to replay them</li>

<li>A lot of feelings stewing around feeling not confident in my own work after the average sentiment was lukewarm at best</li>
<li>I think it stems around sharing inherently incomplete/vague/in-progress work. It&rsquo;s a very weird frustration that comes from mismatches between my mental model, the work itself, and the readers mental model</li>
<li>But this is the great part of feedback!!

<ul>
<li>Over 10k people viewed the blog post for meaningful length of time and HN was surprisingly nice about it :&rsquo;))</li>
<li>A bunch of people reached out asking to chat more about CRDTs (some even asked if I was open to contracting!) Super cool to find more people working in this space and who are as equally excited about it as I am</li>
<li>Most importantly, Kleppmann reached out! I had messaged him to schedule a call at some point but we never found the time. But he saw (and even retweeted!) my blog post and really thought it was solid work.
<ul>
<li>He asked if I would be interested in doing a PhD with him at Munich University. Unfortunately, visa problems combined with the requirement that I get a Masters first mean that I probably won&rsquo;t be taking him up on this offer.</li>
<li>However, we <em>are</em> still going to be formally collaborating on some papers regardless which I am still kind of in shock over. This felt so full circle for me!

<li>Ran into a potential problem with message forgery&hellip;
<ul>
<li>Seems like 
<a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/bft-crdt-papoc22.pdf" rel="noopener">Kleppmanns&rsquo;s Paper</a> doesn&rsquo;t address cases where, say a Byzantine node tries to send a message <em>on behalf</em> of another node (as it knows the unique IDs of other nodes) and forges an update.</li>
<li>This is possible as the unique ID doesn&rsquo;t have any other properties that guarantee that only that the node with the ID can send that message.</li>
<li>We would potentially need some sort of <a href="/thoughts/Public-key-Infrastructure" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Public-key-Infrastructure">PKI</a> assumption where the unique ID of a node is its public key and the ID is the signed digest of the message</li>

<li>This is (sort of) confirmed in 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00472.pdf" rel="noopener">Kleppmann&rsquo;s 2020 paper</a>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;We assume that each replica has a distinct private key that can be used for digital signatures, and that the corresponding public key is known to all replicas. We assume that no replica knows the private key of another replica, and thus signatures cannot be forged&rdquo;</li>

<li>Picked up <em><a href="/thoughts/Seeing-like-a-State" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Seeing-like-a-State">Seeing Like A State</a></em> again, it feels a lot more relevant to my research now for some reason
<ul>
<li>We can think of a <a href="/thoughts/RDF" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/RDF">triple store</a> as a distributed and fragmented SQL database, where instead of tables with rows and value, we have entities with attributes and values.
<ul>
<li>Any application can declare new attributes or alias an attribute to a more common one</li>
<li>The most important part is that applications that share attributes can automatically interoperate their data
<ul>
<li>The harder question is how to build good indices so that when the number of triples grows really large, we still get fast queries</li>
<li>I suspect there&rsquo;s a lot to learn from decades of SQL index/query optimizations</li>
<li>Would like the syntax to borrow from GraphQL</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This type of &lsquo;decentralized&rsquo; database means there is no canonical schema. You can&rsquo;t mistake the map for the territory because everyone has their own map and can&rsquo;t force others to view the &rsquo;truth&rsquo; of the world through your map</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forcing ourselves into schemas make it hard to innovate
<ul>
<li>To make new things requires us to provide migration paths forward or just accept stagnation</li>
<li>It inadvertently shapes what people build &ndash; leads to easily legible/classifiable applications (see: <a href="/posts/digital-identity" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/posts/digital-identity">post on digital identity and legibility</a>)</li>
<li>It is treading outside the map that gives us innovation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This would give us contextual data for app specific data

<li>We can see this as analogous to context dependent personalities (again, <a href="/posts/context-collapse" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/posts/context-collapse">context collapse</a> bad)</li>

<li>Bunch of weird Rust things today
<ul>
<li>Generally, use <code>.take()</code> on <code>Option&lt;Box&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>.clone()</code> on <code>Option&lt;Rc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>.as_ref()</code> is like <code>&amp;</code> but generally acts on the internal reference (i.e. on an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>&amp;</code> gives you <code>&amp;Option&lt;T&gt;</code> whereas <code>.as_ref()</code> gives you <code>Option&lt;&amp;T&gt;</code>)
<ul>
<li>Additionally, <code>.as_deref()</code> basically is just <code>.as_ref()</code> with an additional <code>.deref()</code> on the unboxed value (effectively performing deref coercion)</li>
<li><code>&lt;option&gt;.map(|node| &amp;**node)</code> is equivalent to <code>&lt;option&gt;.as_deref():</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Rc::try_unwrap</code> which moves out the contents of an <code>Rc</code> if its ref count is 1</li>

<ul>
<li>What would it be like to build in interpolation into the state replication level?
<ul>
<li>e.g. similar to 
<a href="https://www.jfedor.org/quake3/" rel="noopener">Quake 3&rsquo;s Networking</a> or 
<a href="https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-cursors/" rel="noopener">perfect-cursors</a> both do 3 types of smoothing:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Interpolation</strong>: If it knows the state of the world at time <em>t</em> and at time <em>t+50 ms</em> and it needs to render additional frames between those points in time, it interpolates the positions of all visible objects between their known two states.
<ul>
<li>That means that when the client is rendering the frame at <em>t+16 ms</em>, it already needs to have received the information about the server frame from <em>t+50 ms</em>!</li>
<li>The only way that is possible is if the client intentionally delays its view of the world in relation to what it’s receiving from the server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Extrapolation</strong>: What happens when the network packet containing the next snapshot is delayed or lost and the client runs out of states to interpolate between? Then it’s forced to do what it normally tries to avoid: extrapolate or guess where the objects will be if they keep moving the same way they’re currently moving.</li>
<li><strong>Prediction</strong>: The only exception here is player input. Instead of waiting for the server to do that and send back a snapshot containing that information, the client also immediately performs the same player movement locally. In this case there’s no interpolation - the move commands are applied onto the latest snapshot received from the server and the results can be seen on the screen immediately. In a way this means that each player lives in the future on their own machine, when compared to the rest of the world, which is behind because of the network latency and the delay needed for interpolation.</li>

<a href="https://stopa.io/post/296" rel="noopener">A Graph-Based Firebase</a>
<ul>
<li>Turns out most modern real-time applications look something like this:<img src="/thoughts/images/modern-app-architecture.png" width="auto" /></li>
<li>SQL seems to be too complex. The common request for data in front end is a complex case to express to SQL. &ldquo;We shouldn’t need advanced features for common cases.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>The most common query is our “fetch nested relations”. This should be supported first class</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We can potentially emulate this using triple stores built on top of an append-only CRDT. <a href="/thoughts/Datalog" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Datalog">Datalog</a> and triple stores have been around for decades. This also means that people have built reactive implementations.</li>
<li>Unsure if we can leverage <a href="/thoughts/CALM-Theorem" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/CALM-Theorem">CALM</a> as its Datalog but <em>not</em> monotonic (facts can be retracted)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DAG instead of append-only log

<li>&ldquo;Both of these abilities follow directly from the explicit embedding of causality into a DAG, with time travel being analogous to a traversal over that graph&rdquo;

<li>How do we enable the &ldquo;other&rdquo; path for high achievers? Not the one where they can just work at a big company, get paid lots of money, life a cozy life, but the harder path in which they truly question the <em>why</em> and ask themselves what they find truly fulfilling</li>

<li>Feels like there&rsquo;s a necessary balance between
<ol>
<li>being deeply invested in something to be able to have a level of almost unwavering conviction</li>
<li>not being so deeply invested that you are oblivious to exploring better potential options</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Leaving space to have conviction is inherently a privilege, how might we enable local spaces of abundance (places for <a href="/posts/play#a-re-worked-definition" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/posts/play">play</a>) so that more people have that privilege?

<li>&ldquo;Many tales exist of [the origin of the bistro]. Some say it was working-class landlords opening their kitchens for extra income. Others say it was the Auvergnats, immigrating to Paris from what is today central-south France, who first worked as rag-pickers, then wood and coal sellers, then metalworkers, who created small working-class restaurants to supplement their income. Either way, it was not planned or engineered, but simply not-disallowed.

<li>Frustrated by 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0160IirdL4" rel="noopener">this video by one of the founders of the Browser Company</a>
<ul>
<li>Their vision is that the &rsquo;next generation&rsquo; of computers &ndash; after the mainframes and personal computers &ndash; is the <em>internet computer</em>, where everything we do happens in the cloud and our machines are just dumb portals to access these
<ul>
<li>We can&rsquo;t be going back to time-sharing! Time-sharing was only a thing because we didn&rsquo;t have access to powerful enough consumer hardware &ndash; this is no longer the case</li>
<li>Not only do you need to always be connected to the internet to use it, it is also incredibly Orwellian except with all-powerful companies instead of states which have detailed metrics into how you conduct every moment of your digital lives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Josh seems to be conflating <a href="/thoughts/local-first-software" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/local-first-software">local-first software</a> with software that is not connected to the internet
<ul>
<li>Just because our data lives locally on our device, does not mean your work is trapped on one device</li>
<li>I think the future is a happy middle between completely offline and completely online &ndash; we&rsquo;ve pendulum-ed to both sides of the spectrum and are perhaps settling on the reasonable option
<ul>
<li>Servers have a role to play in the local-first world — not as central authorities, but as “cloud peers” that support client applications without being on the critical path. For example, a cloud peer that stores a copy of the document, and forwards it to other peers when they come online, could solve the closed-laptop problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Nobody makes native apps anymore&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>People want the <em>performance</em> of native apps without having to maintain many codebases across them.</li>
<li>As more and more apps become &lsquo;internet-first&rsquo;, libraries for storing things locally and reconciling them with remote copies of that data have not made nearly enough progress.</li>
<li>As a result, many &rsquo;native apps&rsquo; are just wrappers for a single source of truth that lives on a remote server. This is not ideal in terms of many things but mostly performance and data ownership.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In a million years time when they dig back down in the archive history of our digital footprint, they won&rsquo;t see vibrant replicas of the web but rather a digital dark age.
<ul>
<li>The documents created in cloud apps are destined to disappear when the creators of those services cease to maintain them.</li>
<li>Cloud services defy long-term preservation.</li>

<li>Really diving into whether a dual optimistic replication (CRDT) + transactional replication (Raft SMR) approach is needed or if one will do
<ul>
<li>Optimistic replication
<ul>
<li>Best for global collaboration. Local nodes can still be speedy even with collaborators from across the world</li>
<li>Can lead to inconsistent states if not careful (again, can use a DSL to help catch these types of errors but it just becomes difficult to write and will require extra research time)
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, have no global invariants. JSON-style data structure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strong eventual consistency data stores (e.g. CRDTs) will hit a few million TPS per second locally for sticky writes with actual TPS being roughly $\frac 1 {RTT}$ (where RTT is ~500ms at worst, ~150ms usually)</li>
<li>Bandwidth use is $n$ (just send to all nodes)</li>
<li>Latency is $\frac 1 2 RTT$ (don&rsquo;t need to wait for reply)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transactional replication
<ul>
<li>Easier to reason about for application developers</li>
<li>Atomic commit-type data stores (e.g. SQL, CockroachDB) still achieve upwards of 28k TPS in a single-region zone. In a global environment, TPS will be roughly $\frac 1 {2RTT}$. This means that if you have a very global team working on something, synchronously collaborating something will still be quite laggy (~1TPS). Doesn&rsquo;t work on an &lsquo;inter-planetary scale&rsquo;!</li>
<li>Bandwidth use is $r n^2 + 1$ where $r$ is number of rounds of the consensus mechanism
<ul>
<li>$1$ for initial request and $r$ rounds of $n^2$ communication between all nodes (overhead can be reduced to $rn + 1$ if normal state is $O(n)$)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Latency is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hybrid
<ul>
<li>Best of both worlds, but the most complex to reason about and write programs for</li>
<li>Alternatively&hellip; what if we expose a simple KV store using CRDTs to exchange routing info? This would open it to easily layering real-time applications on top (e.g. video calls, WebRTC). This eliminates the need for a signalling server
<ul>
<li>This can technically be done already by the user in transactional replication model if they want</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Addendum: the <a href="/thoughts/CALM-Theorem" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/CALM-Theorem">CALM Theorem</a> conjectures that if program state can be expressed in monotonic Datalog, it can safely use optimistic replication.

<li>Visited the Computer History Museum today! Lots of interesting tidbits on how we got to where we are today
<ul>
<li>If economies of scale favoured large consolidated computer systems how did the personal computing revolution happen?
<ul>
<li>One reason is that the main bottleneck to adoption back then was the price. But as Moore&rsquo;s Law continued to hold, hardware became exponentially cheaper due to innovations in chip design, manufacturing, storage, etc.</li>
<li>People started buying it because companies like Apple started branding personal computing devices not as something reserved for only programmers and geeks:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Since computers are so smart, wouldn&rsquo;t it make sense to teach computers about people, instead of teaching people about computers?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There were magnitude level improvements over existing technology. The census for example, took 10x-100x less time using computers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can this be applied to the moving away from large, consolidated, monolithic applications to the personal application era?
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Why is it so hard to own my own hardware?&rdquo; roughly translates today to &ldquo;Why is it so hard to own my own data?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explaining data availability like the differences between calling versus texting someone
<ul>
<li>Calling means that the other person needs to pickup</li>
<li>Texting means that you can still communicate without both being on a call</li>
</ul>

When we can avoid or reduce the need for coordination things tend to get simpler and faster. This theorem tell us when it is safe to avoid coordination.
<ul>
<li>I wonder if there&rsquo;s possibility here to write a DSL (perhaps similar to BLOOM) that compiles to JS/Rust/etc. but also checks for monotonicity properties.</li>
<li>Similar to that Quilt piece on why hiding network complexity in APIs is bad, perhaps baking in these inefficiency warnings (i.e. warning on &lsquo;accidental&rsquo; coordination, is there a way to refactor this program to use a different set of data structures which don&rsquo;t require coordination) into the language</li>

<li>Lots of paper reading&hellip; I feel a little burnt out. I&rsquo;ve been spending almost 15h days just trying to mental sponge as much as this as I can.
<ul>
<li>I think I&rsquo;m getting enough sleep and my eating habits aren&rsquo;t terrible but my body seems to disagree. My eye sometimes just twitches randomly and my stomach has a certain tightness to it that I can&rsquo;t really describe well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A bit of a slump day. Really spent the last month just reading about consensus protocols in <em>partially synchronous system models</em> only to discovery that what I was really looking for was consensus protocols in <em>completely asynchronous system models</em> (which handle cases where potentially majority replicas are offline).
<ul>
<li>I realized this as I was digging into the very last PDF I had in my browser tab on consensus algorithms &ndash; the last of 50 or 60 odd papers I made my way through.</li>
<li>In this last paper, I found out about the <a href="/thoughts/LR-Permissionless-Result" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/LR-Permissionless-Result">LR Permissionless Result</a> which was derived earlier this year in February. It rules out the possibility for deterministic consensus in a Byzantine, permissionless model, which voids my current assumptions about the right type of consensus model for Rhizome.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t think the research and learning went to waste per-se, I feel like I really learned a lot, but it sure feels like that whole month went to waste &ndash; none of the protocols are of any direct use to the project. I just feel incredibly frustrated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A summer retrospective. Anson encouraged me to write a more in-depth reflection on my research processes. I mentioned on a call that I felt unhappy with my progress this summer. I think the bulk of it comes down to doing way too much reading and not enough building and producing things.
<ul>
<li>A large part of this I think comes down to underestimating just how much I didn&rsquo;t know about the space to begin with
<ul>
<li>Every paper I read opened 2-4 new ones. An unknown concept or definition meant another day or two to get familiar with the literature surrounding it. It wasn&rsquo;t until a month ago that the number of tabs I had open started to go down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It feels like the attitude I&rsquo;m taking towards research is one of bumping around in the dark. For the most part its enjoyable and exhilarating, finding things out for the first time.
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s a certain joy to putting yourself in an environment where you can discover things for yourself. I can ask for help when I need it, but most of the time I&rsquo;m puttering along at my own pace.</li>
<li>This is roughly what my self-satisfaction curve looks like for self-motivated exploration:  <img src="/thoughts/images/self-exploration-satisfaction.jpeg" width="400" /></li>
<li>This is usually fine, but when I look at it <em>instrumentally</em>, just from a perspective of how much I&rsquo;ve actually got done, I&rsquo;m a little disappointed in myself.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve decided that I&rsquo;m okay with it. I&rsquo;m not trying to any% speedrun my work. I want to be able to enjoy research for what it is, to visit unexpected results and learn what I find intriguing about it.</li>

But there are so many people working on this and putting their whole hearts and souls into the projects they believe in that I can&rsquo;t help but believe it&rsquo;ll work out.</li>
<li>To quote from Tim Berners-Lee: &ldquo;When I try to explain the architecture now, I get the same distant look in people&rsquo;s eyes as I did in 1989, when I tried to explain how global hypertext would work.

Zach (+ Sam and rest of the HC team) really blew it out of the park this time. The theme was to build something completely useless and the kids went wild with it.

<li>Reading <strong>Weaving the Web</strong> by Tim Berners-Lee.

<ul>
<li>Random thoughts:
<ul>
<li>What if messages were doubly-signed with the hash of application source? This would mean that all events are specific to application version.
<ul>
<li>Holochain cites that this may be a problem: &ldquo;unfortunately anyone can modify their own source chain, regenerate the hashes and signatures, and create a perfectly valid, but wrong, alternate history for themselves.&rdquo;</li>
<li>However, this is actually a non-issue, given we split this into two cases:
<ol>
<li>Single-player App: whatever the user does is &lsquo;correct&rsquo; behaviour anyways, what does it mean to have a wrong alternate history when you are the only person dictating it? All actions will still need to be in the domain of valid actions as dictated by the app (otherwise, message signature would not add up as we sign messages with the hash of application source).</li>
<li>Multi-player App: peers will have a hash of the last known action of a user. If the action history is completely rewritten, the probability of arriving at the same hash is negligible, meaning that the peers will reject any further actions as invalid.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This brings up a new question of what migration paths look like between old and new versions of applications. If we go by hash of application source, then each update to the source code will seem like a completely new application!
<ul>
<li>Each application perhaps can be signed by an author. If a newer application by the same author claims to be an update for the existing application, it can propose an upgrade path to interpret the older data in a usable format for a new one, essentially &lsquo;importing&rsquo; the data in</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good furniture and architectural choices respect user agency, allowing those in the space the ability to move around at will. How might we analogize this to software? <a href="/thoughts/digital-commons" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/digital-commons">Digital commons</a>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read through <a href="/thoughts/Holochain" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Holochain">Holochain</a> docs which are actually quite similar to what I have in mind for Rhizome.
<ul>
<li>Really liked

<li>Everything is self-owned and consistency of application state is maintained by storing hashes of actions to a global <a href="/thoughts/DHT" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/DHT">DHT</a> which allows for peer accountability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Things that I think are unaddressed

<li>Stressed about what to do for the upcoming gap term/year!!
<ul>
<li>Things that are weighing on my mind:
<ul>
<li>I want to graduate. Most visas other than the O-1 visa require at minimum a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree so this is definitely something I&rsquo;m thinking about. Also, a lot of highly technical jobs are (unfortunately) still gated by degrees so having at least a Bachelors is useful in that regard.</li>
<li>I want to be able to spend the <em>at least 3-6 hours per day</em> thinking about this research project. I really think that given I have the financial means to pursue research full-time I should. A younger version of me once said that if they found an idea that excites them when they wake up every morning, they would pursue it without fail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>School Situation: I need 2 more 4xx+ Computer Science Courses and 5 more 3xx+ Electives to graduate. Problem is that it is wayyy past course registration time to jig things around so either:
<ul>
<li>I keep my current course schedule (stay on track to graduate next May)</li>
<li>Unregister from all my courses (push back graduation date to next fall or 2024 May)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Research Situation: Although the research grant is no-strings attached, I really want to be able to output good work that I am proud of. Plus, the people at Protocol Labs are super cool and I want to be on good working terms with them for potential future collaboration.
<ul>
<li>I think summer research has been literature review era and once next semester starts, it will mostly be building things out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other thoughts: in my <a href="/posts/2021" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/posts/2021">Letter to my Future Self</a>, I mentioned I wanted to reach deep focus in whatever work I do and have the resources to be able to choose the work I find enjoyable. I&rsquo;m not going to half-ass do whatever, so it will either be full-send research or full-send finishing school.</li>
<li>Options
<ul>
<li>Keep current class schedule and try to move research to after graduation
<ul>
<li>Not nearly as interesting as working on research</li>
<li>Will graduate on-time in May!!</li>
<li>Less long-term stress about returning to school to finish things</li>
<li><strong>I think I&rsquo;m going to choose this option!!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gap year to purely focus on research
<ul>
<li>Output research work I am proud of, keep good relations with Protocol Labs</li>
<li>Keeps research momentum going, will be more effective than picking up the project a year from now</li>
<li>Will need to go back to school which will feel like I&rsquo;m set back a year</li>

<li>Gordon Brander deep-dive today&hellip; more thoughts on the <a href="/thoughts/inevitability-of-centralization" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/inevitability-of-centralization">inevitability of centralization</a> and <a href="/thoughts/credible-exit" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/credible-exit">credible exit</a></li>
<li>It seems we are reaching that &lsquo;recentralization&rsquo; step of the decentralization-recentralization cycle, with power concentrating in the infrastructure and application level.
<ul>
<li>Gordon proposes abolishing the <code>same-origin</code> policy. His thesis is that this forces resources on the web to be centralized around the ownership of domains. Everything &ndash; security, privacy, identity, data, and scripting &ndash; needs to be provided by the same origin, unless explicitly set otherwise. The &lsquo;hub&rsquo; here that everything goes through is the domain. We&rsquo;ve arrived back at the original centralized hub model of the internet.</li>
<li>How we can learn from the leap that Baran made going from circuit switching to packet switching and apply it to this new layer of the web? In the words of Gordon: &ldquo;Can we imagine a new weblike thing that is to the web as packet switching is to circuit switching?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Content-addressing feels like a viable alternative to how loading resources works on the internet today.
<ul>
<li>Address-based addressing relies on a central registry to figure out where things are. <a href="/thoughts/content-addressed-storage" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/content-addressed-storage">Content addressed storage</a> (e.g. <a href="/thoughts/CID" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/CID">CIDs</a>) <em>decouples</em> the data from the origin. If you know what the hash is, you can request the original file, irrespective of where the file actually lives.
<ul>
<li>There is no single domain hosting your file.</li>
<li>Many copies of your file exist across the network. This redundancy keeps things safe in case of failure.</li>

<li>Roadtrip! Had a really fun roadtrip with Anson, Joss, and Jaclyn from SF to LA. Stopped at a million beaches, observed some stunning sunsets, surfed for the first time, ate great food, and sang lots of songs. Learned about &lsquo;Surfboard&rsquo; by Cody Simpson which was the trip themesong.</li>
<li>On July 25th, I heard back from Protocol Labs and got my first large grant for 20k for the next 4 months!!!
<ul>
<li>I think this support will mean a lot for the project. Protocol Labs is incredibly values aligned and they have some of the brightest minds thinking about similar problems. Even just being in an environment where I know I can expect feedback from these people (not to mention financial support) feels like a major milestone</li>
<li>I really loved how they have an RFP-000 which is an &lsquo;open-call&rsquo; for research that may not fall any other current category</li>
<li>They are strongly encourage I have more &rsquo;traditional&rsquo; research outputs, which I think makes a lot of sense! This will give me more exposure to the more &lsquo;academic&rsquo; side of research as
<ul>
<li>An open-access paper or brief technical report (e.g. submitted to arXiv)</li>
<li>An open-source code library with good documentation</li>
<li>A recorded, shareable presentation of the work, preferably as part of our research talk series (!! this is really exciting).</li>
<li>A blog post describing the impact of your work to be featured it their 
<a href="https://research.protocol.ai/posts/" rel="noopener">research blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I especially love how the grant is &rsquo;no-strings attached&rsquo;. I think this really incentivizes honest behaviour and reporting of <em>true outcomes</em> rather than encouraging fabricated results or demos to get funding.
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>Unsuccessful projects</strong>. Our interest is in accelerating science for the benefit of all. Naturally, over time we will be more likely to fund proposals from active and effective members of our community.  However, we understand the complexities of research and do not revoke payment if the work changes course, is unsuccessful, or reaches a dead end. We value great results but also understand the value of exploration and impossibility results.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Polishing up <a href="/posts/digital-identity" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/posts/digital-identity">identity piece</a>. I&rsquo;ve worked on it enough that I&rsquo;m starting to feel ick just touching it but I&rsquo;m happy that I&rsquo;ve thought about this deeply. Implications for Rhizome as a whole:
<ul>
<li>Self-sovereignty seems useful for agency <em>if implemented in ways that don&rsquo;t force legibility</em>
<ul>
<li>e.g. be careful about <a href="/thoughts/Verifiable-Credential" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Verifiable-Credential">VCs</a> without zkSNARKS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Probably will need to think more heavily about how to model a relation history on the dev side of things as people are used to modelling individual users. Perhaps phrasing the basic item as a <em>group chat</em> makes sense?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Slowly reaching a place where I&rsquo;m happy with the direction of this piece on identity, framing it more around 3 modes of thinking about <a href="/posts/digital-identity" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/posts/digital-identity">identity</a>.</li>
<li>Got a comment from Zoë Ruha Bell on my essay in Reboot that asked about &ldquo;the complexities of how moving data between contexts changes its meaning and that individual control over data may not match up well with the relational information encoded in data&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Incidentally, this is exactly what I&rsquo;ve been thinking more about! My response:</li>
<li>This is a great question and I&rsquo;m still grappling with (and in the midst of writing a whole other piece about!). Data in context is incredibly important. Like identity, when taken out of context, it can be incredibly harmful and misused. Pursuing interoperability without considering the intention behind the actions that data encodes can easily turn dangerous very quickly.</li>
<li>One way I&rsquo;m thinking about this is analogizing the multiple facets and contexts of data as people. Just as people behave differently in different contexts, so can data. The same reason we have so many &lsquo;alts&rsquo; or &lsquo;finstas&rsquo; is that this multifaceted-ness isn&rsquo;t accommodated by existing media platforms. Data platforms similarly treat data as single faceted. What does a multi-faceted encoding of data look like? What does communal ownership of data look like?</li>
</ul>

<li>I&rsquo;ve been trying to write down some more cohesive thoughts around <a href="/thoughts/identity" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/identity">identity</a> for the past two days and running into a block where I&rsquo;m struggling to articulate why and how real world identity and digital identity differ</li>
<li>Just read this blog post on 
<a href="https://rosano.hmm.garden/01evv3hq1ak4b6ng1jzppx5n2j" rel="noopener">Going Doorless</a> that really resonated and gave new language to ideas and concepts that have been floating around in my head for a while
<ul>
<li>Public commons like parks and libraries feel public because moving around in them is effortless
<ul>
<li>We don&rsquo;t have commons because the space between digital spaces have the viscosity of honey. Movement becomes heavily disincentivized.</li>
<li>To be clear: I mean that <em>people</em> should be able to move freely. Data should have access control switches exposed to users. They should decide whether it moves freely or not. &ldquo;after voluntary communication to others, free as the air to common use&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You shouldn&rsquo;t need to pay or set up and account to walk through the gates, commons just let you show up and start using it</li>
<li>Software is the principles of an experience, your data is just the details</li>
</ul>

<li>The other choice of spending this weekend was to go to an Art Book Fair and assemble furniture with friends. In all honesty, I&rsquo;m very glad I chose to focus and write over just socializing.</li>

<li>Part of the nail of my left pinkie ripped off today argH it is now painful to type :((</li>
<li>Realized that when doing site redesign, I lost a commit&rsquo;s worth of notes (sad) but also Obsidian Sync which I normally use for backup <em>also</em> expired today (double sad). Not as bad as it could have been though! Thankfully I commit often :)</li>
<li>Spent a lot of time just reading today, a lot of different scattered blogs that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to get to. 
<a href="https://generative-identity.org/human-identity-the-number-one-challenge-in-computer-science/?curius=1294" rel="noopener">One link that was sent</a> in the Metagov Slack particularly stood out to me though. It was on human identity and, more specifically, a critique of specifically <a href="/thoughts/Self-sovereign-Identity-SSI" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Self-sovereign-Identity-SSI">SSI</a>
<ul>
<li>Long read but I think it captures a lot of my thinking around why I think <a href="/thoughts/digital-permanence" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/digital-permanence">digital permanence</a> is scary (and why I&rsquo;ve been thinking about relational notions of identity!) TLDR;
<ul>
<li>The concept of identity is very noun-like (i.e. tied to physical traits and current state) in Computer Science + software systems</li>
<li>Contrasts with identity as verb-like (i.e. incredibly contextual, based on who you are with, how you are feeling, what experiences you have)
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The joins are the pathways for information exchange and transformation, for organising, and the expansion of organisational identity. Joins give the dots their meaning, their contextual relevance, their identity, just as dots give the information exchange direction and potency.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Reboot published my research proposal / manifesto / essay on Rhizome and data-neutrality today!
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://reboothq.substack.com/p/rhizome" rel="noopener">Check it out on Substack</a></li>
<li>Ben Tarnoff, the guy who cofounded Logic, actually read and 
<a href="https://twitter.com/bentarnoff/status/1547619611796914179" rel="noopener">tweeted about it</a> and readers seemed to resonate a lot with the post!</li>
<li>Two general sentiments:
<ol>
<li>This project seems really exciting and I appreciate it recognizes existing work. What will get people to use this though? The social difficulty with &ldquo;apps as a view over data&rdquo; is that it requires users to understand data models and this consensus over data models has proven difficult
<ul>
<li>I agree with this evaluation and so far, feels unsolved. I think a promising solution is to think about it like how community-sourced types for TypeScript work. There&rsquo;s a whole open-source project that wildly popular that provides TypeScript definitions for plain JS libraries called 
<a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped" rel="noopener">DefinitelyTyped</a> (with over 12.6 million usages!). I think there&rsquo;s a potential for this to work with data schemas as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Well.. crypto/existing-thing actually solves this! Blockchain scaling techniques are getting pretty good, don&rsquo;t see why this work is necessary.
<ul>
<li>Again, true. I think these new technologies all seem really promising and I definitely try to keep up with all the developments in the space but my main concern comes from how convoluted these solutions are slowly getting.</li>
<li>A lott of smart people in crypto have been working on these problems for a while, I&rsquo;m starting to think it might be easier to tackle it from the other side. Plurality of approaches y&rsquo;know :))</li>

<ul>
<li>Ok, a bit of a wrench in the system : &rsquo; )))) CRDTs are incredibly hard to reason with for the average dev and <em>cannot guarantee global invariants</em> without requiring consensus.</li>
<li>Finished up CRDT implementation collection over at <a href="/thoughts/CRDT-Implementations" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/CRDT-Implementations">CRDT Implementations</a>.. I feel like I&rsquo;m getting a better grasp at how to write op-based CRDTs but less so for state-based</li>
</ul>
<a href="#july-11th"><h3 id="july-11th"><span class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"># </span>July 11th</h3></a>
<ul>
<li>Seems like there are a lot of open research questions in CRDTs that I could plausibly spend <em>years</em> working on (e.g. undo operations in CRDTs, encrypted CRDTs using homomorphic <a href="/thoughts/encryption" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/encryption">encryption</a>)</li>
<li>I need to read more about this but it seems like most traditional consensus algorithms require synchronicity from all nodes for them to be considered honest. I wonder how we can reconcile this methods like CRDTs that allow for more asynchronous forms of consistency
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to take advantage of the partially synchronous <a href="/thoughts/system-model" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/system-model">system model</a> and having CRDT-like behaviour in async modes and Raft/Paxos-like behaviour during synchronous periods for compaction</li>
<li>This is especially important as users will rarely have all (or even supermajority) of their nodes online at any given time. Will need to look into variations on Raft that tolerate live membership changes
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The network can partition and recover, and nodes can operate in disconnected mode for some time.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>A lot of good meditations on adoption of tech that gives agency to users at a Hack Night that Rishi hosted :))</li>
<li>Currently at another session of the writing circle. Good to probably zoom out from a lot of the technical in-the-weeds work and re-orient about what this means for the average consumer</li>
<li>Do people care about data ownership and data agency?
<ul>
<li>The average user probably doesn&rsquo;t. They want convenience and are comfortable with current options.</li>
<li>But as a counterpoint, if you ask anyone on the street whether they would be comfortable sharing their entire browsing history right there on the spot, my bet is that ~95% of people will say no
<ul>
<li>This could be a really fun social experiment: incrementally increase the amount you offer strangers to look at their browsing history</li>
<li>How much does the average person value their <a href="/thoughts/privacy" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/privacy">privacy</a>?
<ul>
<li>Yes, companies and the government have a lot of data/info on us</li>
<li>But what has come out of it? For the average consumer, nothing! There is a definitely anxiety of <em>but what if</em> with no real bad cases (that we know of)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another question is why having a <em>real person</em> snoop on your data feels so different than large companies snooping and <em>profiting</em> off of your data
<ul>
<li>I suspect a large part of this is due to learned helplessness</li>
<li>We haven&rsquo;t ever really known what it is like for companies <em>not</em> to be doing that</li>
<li>It feels abstract! A company remotely snooping on your data is something that a user could remain fully blissfully ignorant from</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think people don&rsquo;t care because they haven&rsquo;t known what a possible future could look like
<ul>
<li>People don&rsquo;t ask for cars because all they&rsquo;ve known in their lives are horses. They can only think of faster horses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do we convince the average consumer that this is something worth caring about?
<ul>
<li>Near zero-friction doesn&rsquo;t necessarily people will want to switch to this new paradigm. It is still a non-neglible activation energy to move platforms</li>
<li>This probably won&rsquo;t happen unless there is both 1) a radical <em>push away</em> from existing centralized platforms and 2) a strong and convincing <em>pull towards</em> new decentralized platforms like Rhizome
<ol>
<li>This is where I think regulation, anti-trust, and legal requirements for data usage transparency are incredibly important! There are institutions just as powerful as these large tech companies that can serve as a counterbalancing force too
<ul>
<li>This still feels incredibly difficult as these tech companies have started invading these regulatory bodies and holding immense lobbying power</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We do so by providing tangible and real improvements over existing products (that matter to the average consumer)
<ul>
<li>Never need to manage a million different accounts again</li>
<li>Local-first feels lighter and faster</li>
<li>Easily understandable ToS (people know what access are giving away)</li>
<li>End-user programming should be trivial and non-technical (i.e. making integrations like Zapier useless)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why would companies care about this model of computing?
<ul>
<li>tldr; building and maintaining a data moat is hard</li>
<li>Computation happens almost entirely on end-user devices, need to host massive infrastructure goes way down (unless you are doing heavy ML and info processing, which most companies are not)</li>
<li>New markets for lending compute to the masses rather than just to programmers and tech companies</li>
<li>Almost all the grunt work of data transformations is eliminated so companies can focus on business logic</li>
<li><a href="/thoughts/GDPR" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/GDPR">GDPR</a> compliance built-in, users have freedom to manage their own data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meta-meditations: this was incredibly helpful to iron out philosophy a bit more. I think this is starting to make more sense from both a user and company perspective, but only for people who <em>care</em> about these sorts of things. I think end-game is getting my Mom to understand why this is important.</li>

A concept</li>
<li>One point we talked about that I&rsquo;m still ruminating on is the idea that selling data requires a baseline level of interoperability between two parties
<ul>
<li>How do current data markets work? If Facebook for example sells their data to another company, is it literally a raw export? How does that handoff happen and how do they ensure the format of the data they are using is understandable by both parties?</li>

So many people here are just working on such really cool things and I&rsquo;m excited to potentially have this space as incredibly condensed resesarch + thinking time. I think this is a great forcing function every Sunday to just&hellip; orient myself for the week and get shit done.</li>
<li>Talked with some really really cool people at a birthday party in SF which were surprisingly receptive and interested in my work. Will definitely follow up on these conversations.</li>
<li>More research on <a href="/thoughts/CouchDB" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/CouchDB">CouchDB</a> and other database replication mechanisms to see what I can learn from it</li>

<li>A decent chunk of it is 1) summer courses taking up much more time than I expected them to and 2) wanting to meet people in SF and spend time with Anson while she is still in SF&hellip; priorities priorities</li>
<li>To borrow words from Anson, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;hermit time&rdquo;. I feel like I am definitely behind schedule in terms of what I wanted to get done by this point of summer and I need to put in some serious work and thinking into this project.</li>

<li>&ldquo;Anything new is by nature without precedent — meaning, without data to know whether it will work or not. So when we approach building new things, we don’t optimize for metrics. We optimize for feelings&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;How do you feel when you finally step foot in your own living room, after weeks away from home? When you plop down on your own bed, or whip up a meal in your own kitchen? It conjures up a specific feeling, doesn’t it? That’s because these spaces are a reflection of you — created by you, for you. Software can feel the same way if individuals have agency and sovereignty over what is on their screens.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Chatted with Justin Glibert who gave some very piercing advice
<ul>
<li>What is the most you can cut from your current proposal and have it still be meaningful?
<ul>
<li><em>via negativa</em>: essentially the study of what not to do
<ul>
<li>In action, it is a recipe for what to avoid, what not to do—subtraction, not addition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t know what is going to work but also you know there are things that are obviously not.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to think you are a god and reinvent everything from scratch. Don&rsquo;t catch NIH syndrome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You only have 10 beautiful idea tokens in your life you want to do it so you should just do it
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t just do the plumbing and make stuff you already are good at if you&rsquo;re trying to learn</li>
<li>If this is something you just want to work on (true in this case) then work on it with your full heart</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not being harsh because it&rsquo;s a bad idea
<ul>
<li>But rather I don&rsquo;t want you to waste your time. This is your last summer without &lsquo;real-world&rsquo; responsibilities. I would trade so much to be in your position right now.</li>
<li>I am being harsh so that you spend your time wisely and don&rsquo;t do something stupid.</li>

<li>Proposal re-writes + more research today, got a lot done in office today and still had time to head to Central Park to read&hellip; a great day all things considered.</li>
<li>Open questions from today&rsquo;s reading + writing:
<ul>
<li>How do identity &lsquo;clusters&rsquo; or organizations/groups of people work? How are they represented?
<ul>
<li>Perhaps instead of having separate instantiation of your identity on fixed set of apps, we can have the same identity with separate instantiations of the app?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who runs cloud peers?
<ul>
<li>Have a global marketplace where people can list/sell spare compute and storage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who does the compute?
<ul>
<li>Most apps are lightweight to run on people&rsquo;s own devices</li>
<li>The main reason we&rsquo;ve needed massive datastores and compute centers in the first place is because large companies have centralized billions of people&rsquo;s data into their own servers</li>
<li>Cloud peers can offload and perform heavy lifting if necessary</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More meditations on identity and data
<ul>
<li>Thinking about how data exists only as <em>relations</em> between things&hellip; how do we preserve this?</li>
<li>&lsquo;Data&rsquo; is data in the context of that user (or group of users) using that specific application</li>
<li>Learned about the concept of <a href="/thoughts/petname" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/petname">petnames</a> in more depth today and there&rsquo;s a really cool way of thinking about identity here perhaps
<ul>
<li>Almost all of the contexts in which we collaborate are not global. The <em>you</em> I know is likely different from the you your family knows. Identity should be relational rather than standalone?</li>

<li>Migrated all the tracing stuff out of <code>server.rs</code> and <code>log.rs</code> into its own file. Makes the code a lot cleaner to work with.</li>
<li>Deleted <code>transport.rs</code> (and moved the contents into <code>tests/common.rs</code>) now that it is no longer a part of the server. Realizing now I&rsquo;ll probably need to do another refactor of the transport layer to support simulating network partitions, dropping packets, etc. so I have more surface area to test with.</li>
<li>Talked with Sebastien who has been doing independent research for almost a decade now. Mentioned that I was really feeling like I was in the depths of the Valley of Despair and he just laughed and said &ldquo;that was me 10 years ago and I still feel that way.&rdquo; Horrifying but also weirdly comforting?

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to become good at [x].</p>

<p>And every single day you tell yourself, why am I doing this?</p>

I can&rsquo;t help but sometimes feel like I&rsquo;m wasting my time &ndash; there are so many smart people working on the same problem, what makes me feel like I can be the one to make a meaningful contribution to it?</li>
<li>I know that regardless of whether this project succeeds a lot, I&rsquo;m already learning a lot in terms of technical skills and also about myself in the face of uncertainty and more independent work so I will take that as a win regardless.</li>

<ul>
<li>Discussing grant proposals with Verses folks, doing a lot more grant/proposal writing than I&rsquo;d like these days</li>
<li>Finished most of <code>miniraft</code> logic up until <code>commit_log_entries</code>. Still need to add tests though :&rsquo;)</li>
<li>Tech bear market isn&rsquo;t promising for raising funding, esp for more experimental/greenfield work like this :((</li>

<ul>
<li>Literally just wrestling with Rust&rsquo;s borrow checker because <code>dyn</code> traits are funky :((
<ul>
<li>Ran into a really weird design problem where I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to order the lifetimes of the log or the state machine (should the app own the log which owns the state machine? should the log hold a reference to the app)?</li>
<li>I opted to construct the application first then pass a pointer to the log so that when appending entries to the log, it can just call <code>self.entries.iter().for_each(|entry| self.app.transition_fn(entry))</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally caved and watched an hour long video on closures, <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnOnce</code>, <code>FnMut</code>, boxed closures, and function pointers (
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHkzSZnYXmk&amp;t=3005s" rel="noopener">Jon Gjengset, I owe you my life</a>)
<ul>
<li>Feels really stupid but it was literally a change from <code>&amp;'s mut dyn App&lt;'s, T, S&gt;</code> to <code>Box&lt;dyn App&lt;T, S&gt;</code></li>
<li>When lifetimes get as messy as they did, there&rsquo;s probably a cleaner way to do it with a heap allocated value :)) Use <code>Box</code> more often!</li>

<ul>
<li>Sketching out grant proposals to Emergent Ventures + Protocol Labs</li>
<li>Had a chat with Sebastien about research institutes and what long-term support for work like this could look like in the context of Verses</li>
<li>More implementation work for <code>miniraft</code>, about halfway done I think?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Does not seem promising that my research work will be support by Verses this summer&hellip;</li>
<li>Looking for other places to apply for funding but ugh this is unfortunate</li>
<li>Lots of coding today for <code>miniraft</code>! Finally feeling like I&rsquo;m becoming more fluent in Rust. Figured out some nasty named lifetime stuff today by drawing a few diagrams and kinda feel like a wizard!!! Small wins</li>

<ul>
<li>Mostly writing up recent learnings and incorporating them into the <a href="/thoughts/Rhizome-Proposal" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/Rhizome-Proposal">research proposal</a>&hellip; lots of words today
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m doing research to be able to do more research&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think I am finally getting to a point where Rhizome is making more and more sense and obvious why it is necessary
<ul>
<li>I started this project/research very much like &ldquo;oh wow, this is a cool set of technologies and here are some vague words and feelings about what I think is inadequate in the space&rdquo; and it has sort of refined itself into a clear use case!</li>
<li>Came across the concept of a &ldquo;cloud peer&rdquo; today in Hypercore documentation and it was like &ldquo;WOW I had this exact same idea and they already have a name for it&rdquo; and it was so cool</li>
<li>Really excited about this future of &lsquo;personal cloud computing&rsquo;</li>
<li>I think this summer will be mostly focused on the data replication / identity aspect of Rhizome, realizing that I think I was way too ambitious with my first proposal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More implementation on <code>miniraft</code>. Rust feels so slow to get back into a &lsquo;de-rusted state&rsquo; (hah) where code just &lsquo;flows&rsquo;. It feels fun though! Type system reminds me a lot of Haskell.</li>

<li>What if&hellip; Rhizome had built in mechanisms for managing &lsquo;branches&rsquo;

<li>Default branches are single stream</li>
<li>To make a collaborative doc you can &lsquo;fuse&rsquo; or &lsquo;join&rsquo; branches together temporarily to sync them with each other
<ul>
<li>What if we made something on top of <code>git</code> like this that actually functions on a syntax level rather than a character level&hellip; one for the <a href="/thoughts/idea-list" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/idea-list">idea list</a></li>

<li>First formal architecture sketch?
<ul>
<li>Need to read more about DID and IPFS but this seems like a promising start?</li>
<li>Each user is essentially a DID that is associated with an IPFS document that references a bunch of other things
<ul>
<li>Each device in the devices array runs a Rhizome Node which is essentially a wrapped IPFS node that pins the user IPFS object and can edit it</li>
<li>Right now, this means that if all a user&rsquo;s devices are offline, those files are unreachable. For people who still want their stuff to be replicated online, perhaps can integrate FileCoin to incentivize other nodes to pin their document?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The devices array is also used by Raft to coordinate what devices should be included in the cluster
<ul>
<li>Modifications in the devices array leads to a Raft configuration update</li>
<li>All devices that are reachable sync via Raft to keep an <code>appState</code> object up to date for the user</li>
<li>When any <code>appState</code> log gets too long, it is snapshotted by the leader and persisted in IPFS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All the questions that are unanswered right now are in red. Lots of unanswered questions :))
<ul>
<li>How does auth work for applications?</li>
<li>How will schemas be published? Is there an app store?</li>
<li>Who runs the web host? Is it self-hosted?
