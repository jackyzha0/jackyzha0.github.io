<p>Money is old. &ldquo;We have yet to discover a civilization that didn&rsquo;t have money. So, we know it&rsquo;s at least as old as civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Money is a <a href="/thoughts/language" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/thoughts/language">language</a> through which to communicate value. Then, was does this mean for

<blockquote>
<p>Free as in beer or free as in speech? &ndash; Richard Stallman</p>

<p>Freedom of speech means that our <em>ability to speak</em> is free, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can say whatever we want (e.g. hate speech and defamation).</p>
<p>Similarly for

  data-src="/thoughts/web3/">web3</a>, access to the network is unrestricted (you only need a connection), but saying anything meaningful (e.g. state changing on the shared public record) has an associated cost. Thus certain behaviours we agree to be malicious (like creating fake transactions) are not disallowed, but just economically unsustainable.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t this favour the rich? Well yes, but we can mitigate this by using weighting like

<p>Money, in this context, is not a concrete thing, its an abstraction to communicative values, as a language, and as a technology. It is a classifier for things that exhibit behaviour that lets us use it for</p>
<ol>
<li>Store of Value</li>
<li>Medium of Exchange</li>
<li>Unit of Account</li>
</ol>
<p>More importantly, there are tradeoffs in the above properties.
Gold is a great store of value but sucks as a medium of exchange (interesting tangent, the traditional heuristic that money <em>should</em> have inherent intrinsic value which is separate from the money but the truth is almost the opposite. If the medium used to express transactional relationship has its own value, its not a very functional abstraction).</p>
<p>Historically, like physical materials, we&rsquo;ve just accepted properties the way they are and just built what we could with them. However, also like physical materials, we&rsquo;ve found ways to engineer the fundamental properties that we want.</p>
<p>However, it feels liek we run into a weird
