</blockquote>
<p>Bush envisioned the memex behaving like an “intricate web of trails” similar to the function of the human mind, which he believed works by a method of “association” and not via an alphabetical index. According to Levy (2008, 508), the most “innovative feature” of Bush’s memex system was the establishing of associative indices between portions of microfilmed text—what we now call hypertext links—so that researchers could follow trails of useful information through masses of literature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tapping a few keys projects the head of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions. It is an interesting trail, pertinent to the discussion.</p>

<p>We naturally group things into patterns and chunks and allow us to think on and rationalize at higher levels of abstraction, descending into lower levels only when we need to.</p>
<p>This was demonstrated by chess masters in the 1970&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Players learn to recognize somewhere between 25,000 and 100,000 <strong>patterns of chess pieces</strong>. These much more elaborate &lsquo;chunks&rsquo; are combinations of pieces that the players <strong>perceive as a unity</strong>, and are able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces&rdquo;</p>
