<ul>
<li>How do we distinguish between appeals to authority that are rationally/ethically problematic and appeals to authority that are morally and rationally wholesome and skillful</li>
<li>Two concepts and distinctions
<ol>
<li>Epistemic Culture: what do members of the culture take to be valid sources of knowledge</li>
<li>Epistemic Self: an individual epistemic agent within a culture might have their own idiosyncratic belief about how the source work, how they&rsquo;re weighted, etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Three Knowledge Sources
<ol>
<li>





<a

  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/thoughts/testimony/">Testimony</a></li>
<li>Perception</li>
<li>Inference</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Dogmatism: when one cannot understand differences in epistemic cultures</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re finite, we can only think and see certain amounts of the world and so our brains and bodies are in sub-personal way always helping us intelligently ignore huge swaths of information</li>
<li>Question about demarcation of appeals to authority between good and bad turns into a much larger question that goes into the 





<a
  href="/thoughts/philosophy-of-mind/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/thoughts/philosophy-of-mind/">philosophy of mind</a> and philosophy of neuroscience, the nature of 





<a
  href="/thoughts/the-Self/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/thoughts/the-Self/">the self</a>, how that is created, and how that thing epistemically gains and accesses information in the first place through retention</li>
<li>Defeaters
<ul>
<li>Overriding defeater: given evidence presented, this piece of evidence is a countering piece of evidence that overrides the argument for what they&rsquo;re saying</li>
<li>Undermining/undercutting defeater: some kind of source is fundamentally wrong and nothing comes out of it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is it worth to assess overriding testimonial information from authorities? Whether critical thinking is good?
<ul>
<li>Michael Huemer: you shouldn&rsquo;t! Critically thinking is epistemically irresponsible.
<ul>
<li>We can look to scientific cultures as epistemic enterprises for techniques to make things more robust</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anand&rsquo;s counter-argument: you always need to critically evaluate at least the following
<ol>
<li>who are the authorities?</li>
<li>are they currently properly performing their authority?</li>
<li>what does their authority amount to, within their expertise?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In being an expert and giving expert testimony means that we want the expertise that the person has to be spoken for and performed &ndash; we want an expert performance
<ul>
<li>Can be suspect when the information upon which the expert is drawing is ambiguous</li>
<li>Skepticism starts to creep in because of the bureaucratic complexity through which the message is being delivered
<ul>
<li>Media wise</li>
<li>Interface between medical professions and politics</li>
<li>Corporations that are providing the actual vaccines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Best bet view&rdquo;: if the weighted average of authorities who meet these tests say something, we should trust that it&rsquo;s true (this depends on epistemic culture and epistemic self)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Throwing something from one epistemic culture that&rsquo;s disjoint from another epistemic culture cannot lead to reconciliation without a shared epistemic culture</li>
<li>Two views on argumentation
<ul>
<li>Epistemic: trading of assertions has a way of leading to a better epistemic position either for both parties or for the conjunction of the two parties (





<a
  href="/thoughts/positive-sum/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/thoughts/positive-sum/">positive sum</a>)</li>
<li>Non-epistemic: trying to pull one side to another (





<a
  href="/thoughts/zero-sum/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/thoughts/zero-sum/">zero sum</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not only an issue of 





<a
  href="/thoughts/trust/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/thoughts/trust/">trust</a> but also psychological exhaustion. One of the requirements of any epistemic enterprise is the use of attention
<ul>
<li>Information that puts its receivers into an almost constant state of some kind of cognitive dissonance negative impacts their ability to attend and assess the information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is incredibly important to understand who is an epistemic peer and epistemic non-peers and the differences between peer-disagreement and non-peer-disagreement
<ul>
<li>Huemer counterpoint: non-peers can still be good at catching peers in their performance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Punditry: speaking with a certain level of diction, speed, volume, etc. and it will sound like whatever you are saying is true</li>
<li>One of the main components of collective action is collective belief. We want everyone to do $f$ but that requires everyone to believe that doing $f$ is right</li>
<li>How to ensure it&rsquo;s possible to accurately evaluate whether or not someone is an authority
<ul>
<li>Negative: Not always useful to be screaming about bias
<ul>
<li>At any scale reasonably worth caring about, bias will exist as long as there is order to the universe and entropy hasn&rsquo;t taken over. Bias is what enables salience, for distinction to even be made among differing classes.</li>
<li>However, bias in the context of decision making is something that is seen as a strict negative. Bias here (in the form of preexisting bias, technical bias, or emergent bias) implies a negative systematic preference for the epistemic trust of some agent over enough.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Positive: Look at it mathematically, think about what&rsquo;s at stake and think about what the tolerance threshold is that we can have in the relevant domain
<ul>
<li>From a purely mathematical perspective, this is factual. Achieving consensus is difficult, especially among a wide net of epistemic agents. In fact, without formal processes like voting or delegation, just peer-based discussion leads to a factorial explosion in time-taken to reach consensus.</li>
<li>Thus in most cases, rough consensus (I found this proposal particularly interesting: 

<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7282" rel="noopener">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7282</a>) or trusting delegates (e.g. authorities like the CDC) to not be biased and accurately evaluate other authorities (e.g. scientists and pharmaceutical companies responsible for inventing/deploying the vaccine) is usually suitable when balancing tradeoffs between speed (for example when timeliness during a pandemic is important) and correctness (making sure vaccines are safe to the general public).</li>
</ul>
</li>
